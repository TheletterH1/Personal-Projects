# Michigan State University Automated Twitter Account

This is an automated twitter account I built used to automatically tweet from the account @SpartyStatue at 2:30pm EST everyday. It will tweet the
weather in Fahrenheit, as well as the humidity. On days where there are Michigan State sporting events or holidays it will tweet,
either wishing the team goodluck against the team that they play, or wishing a happy and responsible celebration of the holiday.
