# Michigan State University Twitter Bot

This is a twitter bot I built used to automatically tweet from the account @SpartyStatue at 2:30pm EST everyday. It will tweet the
weather in Fahrenheit, as well as the humidity. On days where there are football, mens basketball, womens basketball, or holidays it will tweet,
either wishing the team goodluck against the team that they play, or wishing a happy and responsible celebration of the holiday.

This project is currently unfinished. If I see fit I'll decide to add more sports schedules and possibly other events to be tweeted out.
