Notes
* This chili is spicy. Consider using a mild chili powder, or add less chili powder to start if you're spice adverse (especially if living in Europe where chili powders tend to be spicier). You can always taste test and add more later.
Storage
Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days.
Portion out and keep in the freezer for up to 2 months.
 
Pickled Red Onions
Servings: 16
Ingredients
2 medium red onions, thinly sliced
1 cup (240 mL) boiling water
¼ cup (60 mL) white vinegar
¼ cup (60 mL) apple cider vinegar

Directions
Add the sliced onions to a large heat-proof jar*.
Next, pour in the water, vinegars, agave, and salt. Seal the jar tightly and give it a few gentle shakes. Transfer to the fridge.
It's best to leave the onions to pickle overnight, but they're still very tasty after just 1 - 2 hours. Enjoy on your favourite sandwiches, salads, or nourish bowls!
Notes
* If using 2 medium onions, a 32 oz (1 litre) mason jar should be the correct size. If using more or fewer onions, scale the size of the jar up or down accordingly.
Storage
Keep the sealed jar in the fridge for up to 2 - 3 weeks.

Vegan Apple Pie
Servings: 6
Ingredients
Filling
35 oz (1000 g) apples, peeled, cored, cut into ½ cm slices†
¼ tsp salt
3 Tbsp (41 g) brown sugar, packed
2 Tbsp (16 g) cornstarch
½ lemon, juiced
1 tsp (3 g) ground cinnamon
½ tsp ground ginger (optional)
Crust
2½ cups (345 g) all-purpose flour
7.9 oz (224 g) unsalted vegan butter, chilled, cubed
½ tsp salt
4 Tbsp (60 mL) ice water
Topping
1 Tbsp (15 mL) vegan whipping cream, for brushing
1 tsp (5 g) granulated sugar (optional)
Serves well with
coconut whipping cream
vegan ice cream
Directions
Place the apple slices and salt in a large bowl and microwave at 600W for 5 minutes*. Mix, then microwave for another 5 minutes. Drain off any liquid released from the apples.
Mix in the brown sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, cinnamon, and ginger with the apples. Set aside to cool.
To a food processor**, add the flour, butter, and salt. Pulse until the butter has been broken up into pea-sized pieces.
Add half of the water, pulsing a few times to combine. Then add the remaining water and pulse again until a dough has formed.
Turn the dough into a bowl or floured surface. Use your hands to incorporate any stray bits into the dough. Don't overdo it, as your hands will start to melt the butter. Divide the dough in two and roughly form each into a ball.
Place 1 ball onto a large piece of lightly floured parchment paper. Sprinkle with some flour. Place the second piece of parchment over top and use a rolling pin to roll it into a ⅛ inch (¼ cm) thick circle, or about 4 cm wider than your pie plate. Repeat with the second ball of dough.
When rolled to size, carefully peel back the top layer of parchment, dust with flour, and place the parchment back on the dough. Flip the dough over and peel back the other layer of parchment. Dust with flour as well. This step helps prevent the dough from sticking to the parchment. Then place both rolled sheets into the fridge to chill for at least 30 minutes.
When ready to assemble, preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Peel off a parchment sheet from the dough and flip it into a 9-inch (23 cm) glass pie plate so that the second parchment sheet is facing up. Use your fingers to lift and press the crust into the pie plate. Try not to stretch the dough. Peel the second sheet of parchment off the crust.
Fill the pie shell with the apple mixture.
To make a lattice top, use a pastry wheel or knife to cut the second crust into ribbons. Weave these pieces over and under one another. Alternatively, just cover the pie with the whole second rolled-out dough***.
Trim any excess dough beyond 1cm from the edges of the pie. Fold in the over-hanging dough and pinch to seal the edges. Brush with cream and a sprinkle of sugar to create a golden crust. Bake in the oven on the lower rack, placed on top of a metal cookie sheet, for 45 - 55 minutes or until the crust is golden.
Although nothing beats fresh-out-of-the-oven pie, we recommend waiting until the pie is completely cooled before serving. Waiting until the next day (if you can make it that long before digging in), and reheating individual cut slices, makes this a great make-ahead dessert. Enjoy!
Notes
† 5 medium apples weigh about 1kg. Use a few more apples if they are small. We suggest using apple varieties such as Granny Smith, Honeycrisp, Pink Lady, Braeburn, Jonagold, Golden Delicious, and Mutsu, for their firm texture and tart flavour. Softer apples like Red Delicious, Fuji, Macintosh, and Gala tend to cook down too much when baked.
* Alternatively, cook covered on the stove.
** If you don't have a food processor, use a fork to "cut" the butter into the flour, or grate frozen butter into the flour.
*** A lattice top allows more moisture to cook off, resulting in soft apples, with just the slightest bite to them. A full double crust keeps the steam in, resulting in apples that are melt-in-your-mouth tender. A few slits need to be cut in the top of a double crust, to allow steam to escape.
Storage
Baked pies can be stored, covered in the fridge for up to 3 days.
Rolled-out pie dough can be stored in the fridge for up to 2 days (allow it to come close to room temperature before fitting into the pie plate, to prevent cracking). The rolled-out dough can also be wrapped and stored in the freezer for up to 2 months.
The filling can also be made ahead of time and stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 days.
Assembled but unbaked pie can be wrapped with plastic wrap and kept in the freezer for up to a month.
 
Vegan Pumpkin Pie
Servings: 8
Ingredients
12 oz (350 g) vegan pie dough
15 oz (425 g) canned pumpkin purée
1 cup (240 mL) soy cooking cream
¾ cup (165 g) brown sugar, packed
¼ cup (32 g) cornstarch
2 tsp (10 mL) pure vanilla extract
1½ tsp (4 g) ground cinnamon
½ tsp ground ginger (optional)
¼ tsp salt
⅛ tsp ground nutmeg (optional)
1 pinch ground cloves (optional)
Serves well with
vegan whipped cream
Directions
Preheat the oven to 390°F (200°C). Roll the pie dough 4 cm wider than your pie plate. Place the crust in a 9-inch (23 cm) glass pie plate. Allow 1 cm of dough to hang over the edges and trim away any excess dough beyond that.
Fold over the overhanging dough and press it down to secure it. Then crimp the edges as desired.
Poke the base several times with a fork.
Crumple up a sheet of baking paper and place it in the shell, filling it to the top with pie weights or dry beans. Bake on the lower rack of the oven, placed on top of a metal cookie sheet, for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, to a saucepan, add the pumpkin purée, cooking cream, sugar, cornstarch, vanilla, cinnamon, ginger, salt, nutmeg, and cloves. Mix until smooth, but don't start cooking yet.
Remove the baking paper and weights from the pie shell and poke the base several times again with a fork. Return the crust to the oven to bake for an additional 8 - 10 minutes, or until lightly golden.
Meanwhile, start cooking the pumpkin mixture on the stove over medium-high heat. Cook for 5 - 8 minutes to thicken*, stirring throughout to avoid scorching.
Remove the baked pie shell from the oven and drop the oven temperature to 350°F (180°C). Pour the hot pumpkin mixture into the hot shell and spread the top out evenly. Bake for 8 - 10 minutes, or until the top of the pumpkin becomes slightly set.
Allow the pie to cool at room temperature for at least 4 hours before slicing and serving. Enjoy!
Notes
* The mixture should bubble, darken in colour, and thicken to a caramel consistency.
Storage
Store the baked pie covered in the fridge for up to 3 days.
 
Homemade Pie Crust
Servings: 2
Ingredients
2½ cups (345 g) all-purpose flour
7.9 oz (224 g) unsalted vegan butter, chilled, cut into 2 cm cubes
½ tsp salt
4 Tbsp (60 mL) ice water
Try this dough in these recipes
blueberry pie
classic apple pie
sweet potato pie
Directions
To a food processor*, add the flour, chilled butter, and salt.
Pulse until the butter has been broken up into pea-sized pieces.
Add half of the water, pulsing a few times to combine. Then add the remaining water and pulse again until a dough has formed.
Turn the dough into a bowl. Use your hands to incorporate any stray bits of flour into the dough. Don't overdo it, as your hands will start to melt the butter. Divide the dough in two and roughly form the dough into a ball.
Place one of the dough balls onto a piece of lightly floured parchment paper. Sprinkle the top of the dough with some flour as well. Then place a second piece of parchment over top and use a rolling pin to roll the dough into an ⅛ inch (¼ cm) thick circle about 4 cm wider than the pie plate you want to use. Repeat with the other dough ball.
When it's rolled to size, carefully peel back the parchment paper, dust with a bit more flour, and place the parchment back on the dough. Repeat on the opposite side. This step helps prevent the dough from sticking to the parchment when it's transferred to the pie plate. Transfer the sheets to the fridge and allow them to chill for at least 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Peel a parchment sheet off from the rolled-out dough and flip it into a pie plate so that the second parchment sheet is facing up. Use your fingers to press the crust into the pie plate through the parchment paper.
If you are "blind baking" or pre-baking the crust for a recipe that doesn't require the filling to be baked (for instance, a pudding or cream pie), remove the top parchment paper and use a fork to prick the dough several times.
Replace the parchment paper and place pie weights or dry beans on top of the parchment and bake for 15 minutes. Then remove the weights and parchment from the pie and bake for an additional 12 - 15 minutes, or until the crust is golden.
For a double crust, remove the top parchment paper from the dough in the pie plate and fill the pie shell with the desired filling (such as an apple or blueberry filling). Peel off one side of parchment from the second rolled-out dough and flip that over the pie filling. Peel back the remaining parchment paper and trim away any excess dough from the edges of the pie.
Seal, crimp the pie edges if desired, and cut a few slits in the top of the pie to allow steam to escape. Brush with some vegan cream or a bit of melted coconut oil and sprinkle with coarse sugar (if making a sweet dish). Bake in the oven for 40 - 50 minutes, until the crust is golden. Enjoy!
Notes
If you don't have a food processor, use a fork to "cut" the butter into the flour, or grate frozen butter into the flour.
Storage
After rolling out the dough, it can be stored in the fridge or freezer until ready to use. Keep in the fridge for up to 2 days or in the freezer for up to 2 months.
Allow the dough to thaw in the fridge before transferring to the baking dish, to prevent it from shattering.
 
Quick Garlic Chili Noodles

1 Tbsp (8 g) gochugaru†
2 Tbsp (30 mL) dark soy sauce
1 tsp (5 mL) black rice vinegar‡
6 heads of baby bok choy
2 cups (200 g) frozen shelled edamame beans
Optional garnish

How to Melt Chocolate
Servings: 8
Ingredients
7.1 oz (200 g) dairy-free dark chocolate
Directions
In a heatproof bowl, break the chocolate into small pieces. This helps the chocolate to melt faster and more evenly.
Using the microwave method: microwave at 600W for 20-second intervals, stirring in between. When the chocolate is nearly fully melted, stop microwaving and continue to stir with a spoon. The heat from the bowl will melt the remaining bits of chocolate.
Using the stovetop a.k.a. "a double boiler": fill a saucepan with an inch (2 cm) of boiling water. Place the large heatproof bowl on top of the saucepan. The water should not touch the bottom of the bowl. Keep the water at a simmer over low heat. Continuously stir until the chocolate is fully melted.
Notes
Scorching happens when some of the chocolate burns while being heated, and this is especially common when chocolate is melted in the microwave. To reduce the risk of scorching, keep the wattage low, stirring often, and stop microwaving when most of the chocolate is melted.
Seizing is when melted chocolate comes in contact with moisture. When seized, chocolate will quickly become pasty and hard. Moisture can come from steam if the water is boiling too rapidly, or from adding a liquid to the melted chocolate, like coconut milk, whipping cream, or milk. Unfortunately, once the chocolate has seized there isn't really anything that can save it - the process needs to start again.
Chocolate can develop a condensation gloss or cloudiness after it's been left in the fridge or freezer.
Storage
Melted chocolate is best when used fairly soon after melting, as it'll harden as it cools to room temperature.
 
Layered Chocolate Raspberry Mousse
Servings: 6
Ingredients
11 oz (300 g) silken tofu, drained
7.1 oz (200 g) melted dairy-free dark chocolate†
½ tsp pure vanilla extract
¼ tsp ground cardamom (optional)
¼ cup (56 g) granulated sugar, divided
4 cups (492 g) fresh raspberries, divided
½ cup (120 mL) vegan whipping cream
1 Tbsp (7 g) cream stabilizer
Optional garnishes
caramel shards
chocolate shavings
Directions
To a food processor, add the tofu, melted chocolate, vanilla, cardamom, and half the sugar. Blend until smooth.
To each of the serving glasses, add ¼ cup of raspberries. Lightly mash the raspberries with the back of a spoon or tamper.
Reserve about ¼ of the blended chocolate mixture in a bowl. Divide the remaining between your glasses over the mashed raspberries. Place the glasses in the fridge while preparing the next layer.
To a large bowl, add the whipping cream, cream stabilizer, and remaining sugar. Whip on medium-high with an electric hand mixer for about 7 minutes, or until stiff peaks form. Reserve some of the whipped cream as a topping if desired.
Then add the reserved blended chocolate mixture to the remaining whipped cream and gently fold together.
Remove the cups from the fridge and add some raspberries (or other berries) as the next layer.
Then divide this whipped chocolate mousse between the glasses.
Top with the reserved whipped cream and any desired garnishes. Enjoy!
Notes
† Melt the chocolate in a microwave or on the stove, using a double boiler. Let the chocolate cool off a bit.
Storage
This dessert is best enjoyed the same day it's made.
Store leftovers in the fridge for up to 1 day.
 
Caramel Shards
Servings: 10
Ingredients
1 cup (224 g) granulated sugar
6 Tbsp (90 mL) water
Directions
Line a baking tray with parchment paper. In a heavy-bottomed saucepan* on medium heat, add the sugar and water.
Avoid mixing with spoons or utensils as this can cause sugar crystals to form. If the mixture needs it, swirl the pan to help dissolve the sugar.
When the sugar is dissolved, turn the heat to medium-high and allow the mixture to bubble until it starts to turn golden, about 10 - 15 minutes.
Watch the sugar closely to avoid burning, as caramelization happens quickly. When caramelized to your liking, carefully** pour the liquid sugar onto the prepared baking tray.
Tilt the tray to spread the sugar out if desired for thinner shards.
Once completely cooled, use the back of a spoon to tap the caramel and break it into shards. For finer caramel dust, you can use a rolling pin to crush the caramel or place the pieces in a food processor and pulse a few times. Enjoy!
Notes
* A heavy-bottomed pan is thicker at the base, meaning it can distribute heat better than a thinner pan. As a result, the sugar will melt more evenly and is less likely to burn.
** Be extremely careful with this, as the melted sugar is incredibly hot.
Storage
Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 month.
 
Tiramisu-Inspired Trifle
Servings: 4
Ingredients
2 tsp (4 g) espresso powder
¼ cup (60 mL) boiling water
⅓ cup (80 mL) cold water
½ tsp almond extract
1 cup (240 g) plain vegan cream cheese†
⅓ cup (80 mL) sweetened condensed coconut milk
1 tsp (5 mL) pure vanilla extract
12 digestive cookies
1 tsp (2 g) Dutch processed cocoa powder
Directions
In a small bowl, dissolve the espresso powder in the boiling water. Then add the cold water and almond extract and mix again.
To a medium bowl, add the cream cheese, condensed milk, and vanilla extract. Use a electric hand mixer* to mix until smooth.
Break one or two cookies into a few pieces, dropping them into the espresso mixture. Then immediately scoop it out and transfer it to the bottom of your serving cup. Use a spoon to crush the cookies in the cup.
Spread a layer of cream (about 3 Tbsp) on top, followed by some more cookie pieces that have been dipped in the espresso mixture.
Add a final layer of cream, and then sift some cocoa powder on top. Enjoy right away, or let it chill for 1 hour in the fridge to let the flavours meld.
Notes
† Choose a cream cheese that has a neutral flavour. Often it'll indicate "plain" or "natural" or "original" on the label. Try to avoid any cream cheese with flavours, such as those with herbs.
* Using a hand mixer will result in a smoother consistency, but a spoon or fork can also be used.
Storage
These dessert cups are best when enjoyed on the same day they're made.
Store leftovers in the fridge for up to 1 day.
 
Coconut Mango Passion Fruit Trifle
Servings: 6
Ingredients
Fruit topping
¾ cup (177 g) passion fruit pulp†
½ cup (75 g) frozen mango chunks
2 tsp (9 g) granulated sugar
Coconut whip
1⅓ cups (320 mL) coconut cream‡
2 Tbsp (17 g) powdered sugar
1 tsp (5 mL) pure vanilla extract
Cookie base
5.8 oz (165 g) Biscoff speculoos cookies
2 Tbsp (28 g) unsalted vegan butter
Optional garnish
chopped mango
unsweetened toasted coconut flakes
Directions
Place a sieve over a saucepan and strain out the passion fruit seeds. Set the seeds aside if desired, to use for garnish.
With the saucepan over medium-high heat, add the mango and sugar. Cook at a gentle simmer for 4 minutes, until slightly thickened. Set aside to cool.
In a large bowl, use an electric hand mixer to whip the coconut cream* for a few minutes. Then add the sugar and vanilla and whip again.
Add the cookies and butter to a food processor and blend into a crumb. Then add 2 Tbsp of the cookie crumbs to each serving glass and press down to form a crust on the bottom.
In the now-empty food processor, blend the mango mixture until puréed.
Spoon a heaping ¼ cup of the coconut whipping cream on top of the cookie layer, followed by a tablespoon of the passion fruit mixture. Garnish as desired, and enjoy!
Notes
† About 10 fresh passion fruits yield ¾ cup of pulp. If fresh passion fruit isn't available, consider using thawed, frozen passion fruit pulp.
‡ Coconut cream is the thicker part scooped out from the top of 2 - 3 cans of full-fat coconut milk (of at least 18% fat) refrigerated overnight. The amount of coconut fat separation can vary vastly from brand to brand. If there isn’t much coconut fat in your can, consider trying again with a different brand.
* Ensure that only the thicker coconut fat is used from the can of coconut milk. Avoid adding any liquid from the can as this thins out the whip and prevents it from staying thick.
Storage
The trifles are best when enjoyed on the same day they are made.
 
Chocolate Quinoa Porridge
Servings: 4
Ingredients
1 cup (170 g) uncooked quinoa, rinsed
1½ cups (360 mL) unsweetened soy milk

Instant Thai Curry Noodle Soup
Servings: 1
Ingredients
¼ cup (60 mL) coconut cream†
1 Tbsp (25 g) Thai green curry paste
1 clove garlic, crushed
4 oz (112 g) firm tofu, drained, cut into ½ cm cubes
¼ cup (18 g) shredded red cabbage (optional)
½ carrot, grated (optional)
¼ red bell pepper, thinly sliced
1 vegetable bouillon cube
½ cup (15 g) fresh spinach, roughly chopped
1.8 oz (50 g) dry white vermicelli noodles‡
2 cups (480 mL) boiling water
Optional garnish
lime slice
sliced green onion
Directions
In a bowl, combine the coconut cream, Thai curry paste, and garlic.
Add the tofu and toss to coat.
If making a to-go meal, transfer the tofu to a mason jar or large heat-safe airtight container. If enjoying it right away, leave it in the bowl.
Layer the cabbage, carrot, and bell pepper over the tofu, and crumble the bouillon cube overtop. Then add the spinach and rice noodles.
Store until ready to eat.
When ready to eat, add the boiling water so that all the ingredients are fully submerged, and stir. Cover and let sit for 5 minutes to soften the noodles. If after this time the noodles are not softened enough to your liking, it could be that the veggies were cold or the water was not hot enough. In this case, consider microwaving or heating on the stove for 1 - 2 minutes.
Garnish with desired toppings and a squeeze of fresh lime. Enjoy!
Notes
† For this recipe, we prefer using the thick layer from the top of the can of coconut milk. If your coconut milk is smooth throughout, not to worry. Using that will also work.
‡ Choose thin, quick-cooking vermicelli noodles. These ideally cook in about 2 minutes once boiling water is added.
 
High Protein Vegan Pancakes
Servings: 4
Ingredients
Pancakes
11 oz (300 g) silken tofu
1½ cups (360 mL) unsweetened pea milk†
2 Tbsp (30 mL) maple syrup
2 tsp (10 mL) pure vanilla extract
2 tsp (10 mL) fresh lemon juice
3½ cups (399 g) spelt flour
2 tsp (7 g) baking powder
1 tsp (5 g) baking soda
1 tsp (3 g) ground cinnamon
¼ tsp salt
1 Tbsp (15 mL) vegetable oil, for frying
Toppings
1 cup (240 mL) unsweetened soy Greek-style yogurt
1 cup (150 g) fresh mixed berries
⅓ cup (48 g) mixed unsalted roasted nuts, chopped (optional)
2 Tbsp (18 g) roasted pumpkin seeds, chopped (optional)
Optional toppings
maple syrup
powdered sugar
Directions

To a large bowl, add the spelt flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt. Mix well. Then add the wet ingredients from the blender. Mix until just combined, but be careful not to over-mix. If the mixture is too thick, add a splash of plant milk to thin it out a touch.
Heat a non-stick crêpe pan on medium-high heat and use a bit of oil to lightly grease the pan. Use a ¼ measuring cup to pour the batter onto the pan. Cook for 2 minutes on each side, or until golden. Continue with the leftover batter.
Top with yogurt, nuts, berries, and maple syrup if desired, and enjoy.
Notes
† We recommend either soy or pea milk for this recipe as the high protein content helps for the fluffiness.
Storage
The pancakes are best when enjoyed immediately, but can be stored separately from the toppings in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.
 
Leek and Spinach Tofu Quiche
Servings: 4
Ingredients
2 leeks
1 Tbsp (15 mL) vegetable oil
1 medium onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
½ tsp salt
5 cups (150 g) fresh spinach, coarsely chopped
½ vegetable bouillon cube, crushed (optional)
1 tsp (1 g) dried thyme
1 tsp (1 g) dried parsley
½ tsp ground black pepper
9.5 oz (270 g) vegan puff pastry dough
1 Tbsp (7 g) breadcrumbs
23 oz (650 g) firm tofu
1¼ lemon, juiced
¼ cup (9 g) nutritional yeast flakes
1 Tbsp (8 g) cornstarch
1 tsp (5 mL) dijon mustard
1 tsp (3 g) ground turmeric
½ tsp kala namak†
1 cup (149 g) cherry tomatoes, halved
Optional garnish
chili flakes
fresh parsley
lemon slice
Directions
Prepare the leek by cutting off the root and the overly fibrous green top. This can be discarded or saved for homemade vegetable stock. Cut the leek in half, wash in between the layers, and then thinly slice.
Place a large pan over high heat and add the oil. Once hot, add the leek, onion, garlic, and salt, and cook for about 7 minutes, or until there is no moisture in the pan and the leeks have softened.
Next, add the spinach, crushed bouillon, thyme, parsley, and pepper and cook for about 2 minutes, until the spinach is wilted and no moisture remains in the pan*. Turn off the heat.
Grease a 9½ inch (25 cm) round tart pan, and lay the puff pastry dough in the pan. Gently press the pastry down and up along the sides, just over 1 inch (3 cm) in height.
Use a fork to poke holes in the bottom of the dough and sprinkle the breadcrumbs along the base. Then preheat the oven to 390°F (200°C).
Ensure that the tofu is sufficiently drained and pressed. If the tofu is too wet, the inside of the quiche can become soggy. To a food processor add the tofu, lemon juice, nutritional yeast, cornstarch, mustard, turmeric, and kala namak. Blend until smooth.
Add the blended tofu mixture to the vegetables in the pan and mix together.
Transfer the mixture from the pan to the tart pan and spread it out evenly. Roll over any excess pastry dough around the rim to create a crust.
Place the halved tomatoes on top, cut side up, and bake on the centre rack of the preheated oven for 35 - 40 minutes, or until the crust is slightly golden and the top is firm to the touch.
Let the quiche cool off for at least 10 minutes before slicing. This time allows the quiche to firm up so it can be cut more cleanly. Enjoy!
Notes
† Kala namak, also known as Himalayan black salt, is a salt often used in South Asian cuisine. The sulphur compounds give the salt an egg-like smell and flavour.
* If the mixture is too wet, the inside of the quiche can become soggy.
Storage
Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.

1½ cups (336 g) granulated sugar
1 cup (106 g) Dutch processed cocoa powder
2 tsp (7 g) baking powder
1½ tsp (8 g) baking soda
½ tsp salt
Wet ingredients
¾ cup (180 mL) unsweetened applesauce
½ cup (120 mL) brewed espresso
½ cup (109 g) refined coconut oil, melted‡
½ Tbsp (7 mL) pure vanilla extract
Frosting
7.9 oz (224 g) unsalted vegan butter, at room temperature
2¼ cups (302 g) powdered sugar
¾ cup (80 g) Dutch processed cocoa powder
⅓ cup (80 mL) unsweetened soy milk
1 tsp (5 mL) pure vanilla extract
⅓ cup (93 g) melted dairy-free dark chocolate
Decoration ideas
chocolate shavings
fresh mint leaf
fresh mixed berries
Directions
Lightly grease two 8-inch (20 cm) round cake pans with oil and line the bottom with cut-out round pieces of parchment paper the size of the base of the cake pans.
To a medium bowl, add the milk and vinegar, and mix. Set aside. You will see it starts to curdle. This creates vegan buttermilk.
Place a sieve over a large bowl, and sift all the dry ingredients through it. Mix together, and then create a shallow well in the middle. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
Returning to the medium bowl containing the buttermilk, add all of the remaining wet ingredients. Mix thoroughly.
Add all the wet ingredients to the shallow well in the dry ingredients and mix until everything is just combined, but be careful not to overmix.
Divide the cake batter between the two cake pans. Gently tap the pans on the counter a couple of times to level out the batter and to remove any air bubbles. Bake in the centre rack of the preheated oven for 35 minutes, or until a thin wooden skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.
Meanwhile, make the frosting. To a large bowl, add the butter and use a electric hand mixer to beat the butter until fluffy.
Then add the powdered sugar, cocoa powder, milk, and vanilla. Start mixing at a low speed and then gradually increase until smooth. Once the melted chocolate has cooled off a bit, mix it in as well.
When the cakes are done baking, let them cool off for 10 minutes in the cake pan before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely*. If desired, the cakes can be levelled out with a serrated knife to create a flat surface for stacking the cakes on top of each other.
Rip a piece of parchment paper into 6 pieces and place these in a circular shape on the cake stand just wider than the size of your cake. These papers help to keep the cake stand clean and will be removed later. Place one of the cakes on the cake stand.
Spread a layer of frosting on top of the first cake. Place the second cake on top upside down and frost the top and sides with the leftover frosting.
Remove the parchment paper squares from under your cake.
Decorate the chocolate cake with desired toppings, and enjoy!
Notes
† We recommend using either soy or pea milk for this recipe, as the high protein content of these milks are what allows the milk to curdle to create vegan buttermilk. We can't guarantee other plant-based milk will be successful.
‡ We do not recommend swapping out the coconut oil for other vegetable oils, as other oils will affect the final texture of the cake. Refined coconut oil is recommended as it doesn't impart a coconut taste and scent. If you don't mind the taste of coconut in your cake, unrefined coconut oil can also be used here.
* Be patient with this, as a warm cake will cause the frosting to melt when applied.
Storage
Best if this is enjoyed immediately. The cake can be stored in the fridge for up to 3 days. But among friends and family, this cake won't last very long!
The frosting can be made ahead of time and stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.

Homemade Beet Pasta
Servings: 4
Ingredients
3.5 oz (100 g) cooked beets, peeled
¼ cup (60 mL) water
2 cups (308 g) type 00 flour
¼ tsp salt
Directions
Blend the beets and water together using an immersion blender or regular blender. Blend until smooth.
Pile the flour and salt on a clean counter. Mix together, and then make a well in the center and pour the beet purée into the well.
Use a fork and start gradually adding the flour to the beet purée by whisking the fork through the purée and picking up a small amount of the flour at the edges of the purée.
Continue to pick up flour with the fork until a cohesive dough forms, then knead the dough until all the flour is incorporated into a ball. Note the mixture is supposed to be quite dry. Continue to knead. This takes a lot of strength and patience, about 10 - 15 minutes. Once the dough is smooth, wrap it in plastic and let it rest in the fridge for 30 minutes.
Once the dough has rested, remove it from the fridge and divide it into 4 pieces. The dough can now be rolled out by hand or with a pasta roller.
If using a rolling pin, roll and push the dough out as thin as it can go without ripping*. Lift and dust the dough with flour as needed. It's rolled well enough when you lift the dough and see the outline of your hand behind the dough.
Once the dough is rolled out, lightly dust with more flour. Then roll the dough up into a cylinder and cut it into strips with a sharp knife.
Unravel the noodles and toss them in more flour and leave them in a nest on your counter as you continue to roll and cut the remaining dough. At this point, you can either dry on a pasta drying rack, or freeze the noodles for storage if you are making the noodles in advance.
When you are ready to cook the noodles, add them to a large pot of salted, boiling water to cook for 2 minutes. Cook in batches if needed to avoid overcrowding the pot. If your noodles are thicker, test one to check for doneness before removing them from the water, you may need to cook them for an extra 30 seconds - 1 minute.
Remove the noodles from the water and toss with desired sauce*. Enjoy!
Notes
* If you are struggling to roll the dough, use less flour on the counter and let the slightly sticky surface of the counter help to pull the dough out as you roll over it.
* To let this pasta really shine, we made a simple sauce by adding vegan butter to a pan with a couple of cloves of minced garlic. Once the garlic was cooked slightly, we added the cooked pasta and garnished it with fresh black pepper, sea salt, and some sliced fresh basil.
Storage
It's best to use the fresh pasta dough within 12 hours of making it.
The fresh-cut noodles should be cooked the day they are made. Otherwise, they can be dried completely on a pasta drying rack and stored in airtight containers at room temperature for up to 5 days, or frozen and stored in the freezer for up to 1 month.
Cook the frozen pasta the same as you would for fresh - for 2 minutes in salted, boiling water.

Vegan Onigirazu: Rice Sandwiches
Servings: 6
Ingredients
1½ cups (300 g) uncooked Japanese short-grain rice†
2 cups (328 g) cooked chickpeas
¼ cup (36 g) chopped pickles
¼ cup (60 mL) vegan mayonnaise
3 Tbsp (30 g) minced onion
2 Tbsp (30 mL) ketchup
1½ Tbsp (22 mL) rice vinegar (optional)
1 tsp (5 g) granulated sugar (optional)
¼ tsp salt (optional)
6 nori seaweed sheets
½ cucumber, thinly sliced using a vegetable peeler
½ cup (35 g) shredded red cabbage
6 butter lettuce leaves
Serves well with
sodium-reduced soy sauce
sriracha mayo
Directions
Wash the rice and cook it according to the package instructions.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, use a fork to mash the chickpeas. Then add the mayo, onion, pickles, and ketchup and mix to combine.
Optional step: to make flavoured rice, add the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt to a small bowl and mix until the sugar has dissolved completely.
When the rice is cooked, transfer it to a large shallow bowl to cool off slightly and gently stir in the vinegar mixture while the rice is still warm. Be careful not to over-stir.
Take a nori sheet and lay it out with the point towards yourself and rough side up. Place a bowl of water next to you for dipping your fingers into. Wet your fingers with a little bit of water so that the rice won't stick to your hands as much.
Scoop out a packed ⅓ of a cup of sushi rice and place it in the middle of the nori sheet. Use your hands to shape it into a square of ½ inch (1 cm) thickness. Form the square such that the flat side is facing you (see the photo for guidance).
On top of the rice square, add a layer of lettuce, followed by 3 packed tablespoons of the chickpea mixture. Using the back of a spoon, spread out the chickpea mixture to align with the shape of the rice underneath it.
Then add on top a single layer of sliced cucumber and red cabbage.
Dip your fingers in more water, and then scoop up another ⅓ of a cup of sushi rice. Add this scoop into the palm of your hand, and use your fingers to form another rice square about ½ inch (1 cm) thick. Gently place this on top of the sandwich*.
Fold in two opposite points of the nori sheet so that they meet on top of the rice, and use a bit of water to help them stick together where they meet.
Then, as if wrapping a present, tuck in and then fold over and the other two points to fully enclose the rice and fillings inside the nori. Use a little bit of water to close and seal the rice sandwich. Set it aside for 5 minutes while preparing the remaining sandwiches.
Cut the onigirazu in half using a sharp, slightly wet knife which helps the rice from sticking to the knife. Garnish with black sesame seeds and serve with sriracha mayo and soy sauce!
Notes
† The rice might be labelled as "sushi rice" at your grocery store.
* Alternatively, you can place this rice right on top of the pile of veggies and shape it into a square when the rice is on the stack. It might fall apart a little bit this way, but don't worry too much about it. It doesn't need to be perfect.
Storage
The onigirazu is best when enjoyed on the same day, but can be stored uncut, wrapped in kitchen towel in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 days.
The kitchen towel will help to prevent the rice from drying out. Just cut the onigirazu in half on the day you're ready to enjoy!

Homemade Hazelnut Butter
Servings: 24
Ingredients
3 cups (405 g) raw blanched hazelnuts†
Directions
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Spread the hazelnuts onto a baking tray and bake for 9 - 10 minutes, until lightly golden and fragrant, stirring once halfway*.
Place the toasted hazelnuts in a food processor (ideally 600W or higher). Using a blender is not advised as there is not enough liquid. Blend on high for about 5 minutes, or until a nut butter consistency is formed. The mixture will go from crumbly to smooth over this time*.
Notes
† If your hazelnuts have the brown skin still on, you'll have to remove it after you take them out of the oven. When cooled enough to handle, rub them firmly between the palms of your hands.
* Be careful not to overcook, as the nuts continue to 'cook' even when taken out of the oven.
* You may need to blend it for an extra 5 minutes to achieve the desired consistency or consider adding a bit of vegetable oil or coconut oil.
Storage
Store in an airtight container or mason jar in a cool, dry, and dark place for up to one month. Store in the fridge for up to three months.

Vanilla Coconut Matcha Latte
Servings: 2
Ingredients
To make the powdered mix
4 tsp (18 g) vanilla sugar
2 tsp (4 g) matcha powder†
1 tsp (4 g) coconut sugar
To make the lattes
1½ cups (360 mL) barista oat milk‡
1 cup (240 mL) canned light coconut milk
¼ cup (60 mL) hot water, at around 80°C/175°F
Directions
To a jar, add the vanilla sugar, matcha powder, and coconut sugar. Mix to combine*.
To a saucepan, add the oat milk and coconut milk to heat up. Whisk throughout, and remove from the heat when hot, but not yet boiling.
To make one latte, add 1 Tbsp of the powdered mix and 2 Tbsp (30 mL) of hot water to each cup. Avoid using boiling water straight out of the kettle as this can make the matcha bitter. Whisk until no lumps remain.
Divide the hot milk between your cups and top with foamed milk, if desired. Enjoy!
Notes
† A premium grade of matcha is preferable for this drink over culinary or cooking grade matcha.
‡ Nutrition tip: aim to use plant-based milk that is fortified with calcium.

Homemade Vanilla Sugar
Servings: 2
Ingredients
2 cups (448 g) granulated sugar
1 vanilla pod
Try this in
blue butterfly pea latte
golden latte instant mix
red velvet latte
Directions
Add the sugar to a food processor.
Use a small paring knife to slice the vanilla pod in half lengthwise, but try to not cut all the way through.
Open the vanilla along the newly cut seam and use the back of the knife to scrape out the seeds. Add this to the food processor as well. Reserve the emptied vanilla pod for a later step.
Blend the sugar for about 3 - 4 minutes, or until you achieve a fine, almost powder-like consistency. Pour the vanilla sugar into a jar.
Submerge the reserved, empty pod into the sugar. If the pod doesn't fit into your jar, cut it into smaller pieces.
Store the vanilla sugar at room temperature in a cool and dry place for at least 2 weeks for optimal flavour. Make sure to give the jar or container a shake every few weeks as there is a possibility that the sugar can clump together.
Storage
Store at room temperature in a cool and dry place for up to 6 months.

Try making your own
homemade pizza dough
Directions
To a large pan on medium-high heat, add the oil and sliced onions. Cook for 25 - 30 minutes, until the onions are golden. In the last 5 minutes of cooking, add the Italian seasoning.
While the onions cook, make the feta by adding the tofu, oil, nutritional yeast, vinegar, onion powder, salt, and dill to a small food processor. Blend until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate to harden*.
Preheat a pizza stone and the oven to 500°F (250°C)**. Optionally, brush the pizza crusts with some olive oil.
Transfer the onion mixture to a small food processor. Blend until a partly pureed, partly chunky mixture is achieved. This blending step is optional.
Spread the blended onion mixture over the pizza crusts.
Distribute the cut grapes over the crusts as well, then transfer the pizza to the oven.
Bake on the center rack for 8 - 10 minutes***, or until the crust is golden.
Top with the sliced pears, arugula, "feta", a drizzle of balsamic vinegar reduction, and some toasted walnuts. Enjoy!
Notes
† Refined coconut oil is coconut oil that doesn't smell or taste like coconuts.
* The tofu feta is quite spreadable, almost like a ricotta texture, straight from the food processor. The longer it sits in the fridge, the more crumbly it becomes.
** If you don't have a pizza stone, bake the pizzas on a parchment-lined baking tray at 390°F (200°C) or at 450°F (230°C).
*** Bake for 15 - 17 minutes if the oven is at 390°F (200°C), or for 12 minutes if at 450°F (230°C).
Storage
The pizza is best enjoyed fresh.
Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 days.
 
Homemade Pizza Dough
Servings: 2
Ingredients
1 tsp (4 g) active dry yeast†
¾ cup + 2 Tbsp (210 mL) lukewarm water
2½ cups (385 g) type 00 flour, plus extra for dusting‡
1 tsp (6 g) salt
2 Tbsp (30 mL) olive oil
2 Tbsp (14 g) breadcrumbs, optional for sprinkling on pizza peel
Enjoy this dough in
fruity caramelized onion & feta pizza
Mexican Pizza
Directions
Mix together the yeast and warm water in a small bowl. Let sit for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, mix together the flour and salt in a separate large bowl.
To the yeast mixture, add the olive oil, and then pour this liquid into the bowl with the flour.
Stir and knead until the dough resembles a rough ball, then cover with a damp kitchen cloth and let rest for 15 minutes.
Transfer the rested dough to a lightly floured work surface. Knead for 3 minutes, until smooth. Sprinkle more flour on your hands and working surface if the dough starts to stick, and continue to knead.
Cut the dough into your desired number of pieces. The dough is enough to make 2 medium (23 cm) pizzas or 3 smaller (18 cm) pizzas. Fold in the sides, flip the dough so that the seam sides are facing down, and pull each piece of dough along your table to create a tight ball.
Place these balls on a floured surface covered with a damp cloth at room temperature to rest for 3 - 4 hours*.
Alternatively, store the balls overnight in the fridge in large, greased, airtight containers. If refrigerated overnight, first remove the dough from the container, pull it into a tight ball again, and let it rest at room temperature covered with a damp cloth for 1 hour to allow the dough to warm up. This will make it easier to shape.
When ready to bake, preheat a pizza stone* and oven to the highest temperature your oven can be set to. Using your fingers, press the dough into the desired size, starting from the middle and working your way to the edges, leaving about 1 cm of dough untouched around the perimeter which will become the pizza crust.
If using a pizza peel, lightly sprinkle the peel with fine breadcrumbs, semolina, flour, or cornmeal to help prevent the dough from sticking.
Gently lift the stretched dough and transfer it to the prepared peel. Try to place it close to the edge, as that can make it easier to slide onto the pizza stone. While the pizza is on the peel, top it with your desired toppings.
Bake the pizza on the pizza stone until golden, about 8 minutes if at 500°F (250°C), or for 12 minutes if at 450°F (230°C). Check on it in the last couple of minutes to ensure it doesn't overcook. When removed from the oven, add your favourite fresh toppings and enjoy!
Notes
† Speed up this recipe by using double the amount of yeast listed. Let the dough rest at room temperature covered with a damp cloth for 30 minutes after being kneaded. Note, the yeast taste will be more prominent this way.
‡ Type 00 pizza flour contains more gluten than bread or all-purpose flour. It creates a very airy, light, chewy crust. All-purpose dough can be used but will result in a slightly denser crust.
* Pizza stones can shatter if they are placed into a preheated oven without being slowly warmed up to temperature. If you don't have a stone, bake the dough on a lined baking tray (this does not require pre-heating).
Storage
The uncooked dough can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 days or in the freezer for up to 1 month.
Cooked dough is best the day it's made.

Ingredients
½ cup (100 g) dry split mung beans, soaked overnight†
1 cup (200 g) uncooked basmati rice, soaked overnight
¼ cup (60 mL) vegetable oil
1 medium onion, grated or minced
1 tsp (2 g) ground cumin
½ tsp ground turmeric
½ tsp salt
½ tsp ground black pepper
1 cup (240 mL) water, plus more for the rice
Garlic yogurt sauce
½ cup (120 mL) unsweetened soy yogurt
1 clove garlic, crushed
¼ tsp salt
Optional garnish
fresh cilantro
Serves well with
banjan - Afghan eggplant dish
salata (Afghan salad)
Directions
After an overnight soak, much of the skin separates from the mung beans. Traditionally, the skin is scooped out before cooking, but this is optional. Rinse and drain both the mung beans and rice.
Heat the oil in a large pot on medium heat. When hot, add the onions and cook until very golden, about 10 - 12 minutes. We want the onions a deep brown but without burning them.
Then add the drained mung beans, increase the heat to medium-high, and cook for 3 - 4 minutes to lightly toast. Stir often.
Add the spices and cook for 1 more minute, stirring throughout.
Add the water and cook for 3 minutes, or until boiling.
Add the rice and cover it with enough water so that the water is about ½ inch (2 cm) above the rice*. Bring to a boil, partially cover, reduce to a gentle simmer, and cook for 15 - 20 minutes.
To make the garlic yogurt sauce, combine the yogurt, garlic, and salt in a small bowl. Set aside until ready to serve.
Returning to the rice, remove the lid, mix the cooked rice to fluff it, then use the end of a wooden spatula to create 5 holes in the rice.
Taste test. If the rice is not yet cooked, add a small splash of water. Then wrap the lid of the pot with a clean dish towel and place this over the pot. Let sit for 5 - 7 minutes on low heat.
To serve, top the rice with a drizzle of the garlic yogurt sauce. Enjoy!
Notes
† Find split mung beans at your local Persian grocery store. You can use whole mung beans instead as well, but they should be soaked overnight and then cooked in the boiling water for 8 - 10 minutes before the rice is added, to ensure that the rice and beans are done cooking at the same time. When the soaked mung beans are rinsed, the skins should come off.
* Careful to not add too much water, as more water can always be added later.
Storage
Keep the kitchari separate from the garlic yogurt in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.
 
Chickpea and Rice Tortilla Soup
Servings: 4
Ingredients
Soup
1 Tbsp (15 mL) vegetable oil
1 medium onion, finely chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 cups (480 g) canned diced tomatoes
2 Tbsp (18 g) burrito seasoning
6 cups (1440 mL) boiling water
2 vegetable bouillon cubes, crushed
2½ cups (410 g) cooked chickpeas
¾ cup (150 g) uncooked white rice, rinsed
¼ tsp salt, plus more to taste
¼ tsp ground black pepper, plus more to taste
Tortilla chips
4 large soft tortillas
1 Tbsp (15 mL) vegetable oil
½ tsp salt
⅛ tsp ground black pepper
Optional garnish
fresh cilantro
lemon slice
sliced chili pepper
Directions
Heat a large pot over medium-high heat and add the oil, onion, and garlic. Give it a stir and let it cook for 2 - 3 minutes, or until translucent.
Add the tomatoes and burrito spice mix and let it cook for another 2 minutes. Stir occasionally. Next, add in the water, bouillon cube, chickpeas, rice, salt, and pepper. Stir.
Bring the soup to a simmer and let it cook uncovered for 15 - 20 minutes, or until the rice is fully cooked. Next, preheat the oven to 390°F (200°C) and line a baking tray with parchment paper.
Cut each tortilla into 12 pieces and transfer the pieces to a large bowl. Pour the oil, salt, and pepper over the tortillas. Toss and massage with your hands to coat.
Lay the pieces in a single layer over one or two parchment-lined baking trays*.
Bake in the oven on the middle and lowest rack for 3 - 4 minutes. Then flip the tortillas over and return to the oven to bake for another 3 - 4 minutes. Remove from the oven when the edges of the chips are toasted. Keep an eye on them during baking because they can easily over toast.
When the soup is done, serve with the baked tortilla chips. Enjoy!
Notes
* Crowding all the pitas onto one tray can cause the chips to steam rather than roast, which might prevent them from getting crispy.
Storage
The soup can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days.
The tortilla chips can be stored in a container on the counter for up to 3 days.
 
Roasted Vegetable Salad with Crispy Chickpeas

Directions
Preheat the oven to 430°F (220°C). Add the chickpeas to a lined baking tray, drizzle over the oil, and the burrito spice seasoning. Toss to coat.
To a separate large lined baking tray, add the potatoes, carrots, unpeeled garlic, oil, and burrito seasoning. Toss to coat. Roast both trays for 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, place the frozen peas in a medium bowl and cover them with plenty of boiling water. Let sit for 10 minutes.
Remove the trays from the oven and stir. To the veggie tray, add the onion wedges. Return the trays to the oven with their positions swapped, and roast for an additional 15 - 25 minutes, or until cooked to your liking.
Drain the peas and mash with a fork, then add the yogurt, salt, and pepper to the peas and mix.
When the roasted garlic is cool enough to handle, peel and mash the cloves with a fork. Add this to the yogurt sauce. Mix. For a smoother consistency, blend the yogurt sauce with an immersion blender, although this is optional. Taste test and add more salt if desired.
To assemble, divide the spinach between bowls. Top with the roasted veggies and chickpeas. Add a dollop of the pea yogurt sauce before digging in. Enjoy!
Notes
† Nutrition tip: aim to use plant-based yogurt/milk (choose one) that is fortified with calcium.
Storage
The assembled salad is best enjoyed immediately.
The roasted vegetables and yogurt dressing can be stored separately in airtight containers in the fridge for up to 4 days.
The chickpeas can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge or at room temperature for up to 3 days. Note, they will likely lose their crispiness if not enjoyed immediately. To make re-crispy, simply toast in the oven for a few minutes if desired.
 
Ingredients
4 small eggplants†
1¼ cups (300 mL) vegetable oil‡
4 cloves garlic, crushed
2 green chili peppers, sliced lengthwise
3 medium tomatoes, chopped
2 Tbsp (33 g) tomato paste
½ tsp ground turmeric
1 tsp (6 g) salt
1 medium yellow onion, sliced into ½ cm thick rounds
2 medium tomatoes, cut into 1 cm thick rounds
Garlic yogurt sauce
1 cup (240 mL) unsweetened soy yogurt
2 cloves garlic, crushed
½ tsp salt
Serves well with
salata (Afghan salad)
whole wheat pita bread
Directions
Peel the eggplants. Cut them through the middle horizontally and then slice them into 1 cm thick planks. Heat the oil in a sauté pan over high heat.
When the oil is hot, carefully add a few eggplant slices. Cook until golden, about 2 - 3 min per side. Transfer the fried eggplant to a strainer set over a bowl to allow any excess oil to drain. Repeat until all the eggplants are cooked.
There should be leftover oil in the pan after frying the eggplant. For the following steps, we will need ¼ cup (60 ml) of oil*. Reduce the temperature to medium. Add the garlic (careful as it may splatter). Cook until fragrant and golden, about 30 seconds. Stir throughout.
Add the green pepper, chopped tomatoes, tomato paste, turmeric, and salt. Stir and cook for another 1 - 2 minutes.
Drop the heat to medium-low. Place the sliced onion over the sauce in a single layer. Then lay half the eggplant over the onions, layer the tomato slices over that, and finish with the remaining eggplant slices. Cover the pan and cook until the onions are soft, about 20 minutes**.
Meanwhile, make the sauce by combining the yogurt, garlic, and salt in a small bowl.
Add some of the yogurt sauce to the base of a serving dish. Then scoop up the eggplant, tomato, and onion mixture and transfer it to the dish. Remove the peppers from the bottom of the pan and place them decoratively on top. Scoop up any remaining sauce and drizzle over the dish.
Finish with another drizzle of yogurt sauce, dried mint, and paprika powder for garnish. Serve with bread and enjoy!
Notes
† Preferably, use the dark purple variety of eggplants, also known as the globe eggplants.
‡ If you'd prefer to use less oil, try our "Kichaloo Banjan" recipe.
* If there is more than that, carefully scoop some oil out. If there is less than that, add a bit more oil to the pan.
** Try not to stir, if possible, so that the onion and tomatoes retain some of their shape, otherwise they get "mushy".
Storage
This dish is best the day it's made.
Store leftover Banjan and yogurt sauce separately in airtight containers in the fridge for up to 3 days.
 
Afghan Green Chutney
Servings: 16
Ingredients
3 cups (48 g) fresh parsley, packed, washed
3 cups (48 g) fresh cilantro, packed, washed
5 cloves garlic
½ cup (50 g) raw walnuts
3 green chili peppers, seeds removed (fewer if you prefer less spice)
1 tsp (6 g) salt
¼ tsp ground black pepper
1 cup (240 mL) white vinegar
Serves well with
bolani - Afghan stuffed flatbread
Directions
To a large food processor, add the parsley, cilantro, garlic, walnuts, chili peppers, salt, and pepper. Blend until minced, but be careful not to purée.
Finally, add the vinegar and pulse 2 - 3 times, or simply stir the vinegar in with a spoon.
Transfer to a mason jar, filling it no more than ¾ full. Don't cover with a lid yet, as we want to let the chutney 'breathe' overnight* while in the fridge.
The next day, seal the jar. If using a metal lid, wrap the lid with plastic wrap first so the metal does not rust and leach into the jar. Enjoy!
Notes
* When covered too soon, the chutney can sometimes bubble out of the jar, making a mess. If you prefer to still cover it while it's in the fridge, we advise opening the lid every 4 - 6 hours on the first day to let the jar "burp".
Variations: you can add fresh mint leaves, fresh ginger, ground turmeric, cumin seeds, or some sugar if desired to vary the flavours.
Storage
Store in an glass jar in the fridge for up to 4 months.

Trim the tops off the eggplants. Using a potato peeler, create a decorative pattern in the skin of the eggplant by peeling alternating stripes in the eggplant lengthwise. Then slice the eggplant into rounds, just over ½ inch (1½ cm) thick.
Transfer the eggplants to a large bowl, and sprinkle the salt overtop. Then using your hands, massage the salt onto both sides of each piece of eggplant.
Let the eggplants sit in the bowl for at least 2 hours, and up to 4 hours. This helps to draw water out of the eggplant and allows for less oil to be used later. You should notice by the end the eggplant is "sweating" and there is a pool of dark water in the bowl that has leached from the eggplants.
Using a clean kitchen cloth, squeeze as much water out of each eggplant piece as possible.
To a sauté pan on high heat, add half of the oil. When hot, drop the heat to medium and add half of the eggplant in a single layer. Let fry until golden, then flip. When both sides are golden, set aside on a plate. Then repeat with the other half of the oil and eggplants.
When the last of the eggplant is cooked on both sides, drop the heat to low and layer the sliced potatoes, tomatoes, and previously cooked eggplants into the pan.
Meanwhile, to a small pan on medium-high heat, add the oil and garlic. Cook until the garlic becomes golden, about 3 minutes.
Then add the turmeric and salt, stirring for 20 seconds.
Add the boiling water. Stir so that the turmeric dissolves in the water. Pour this liquid over the veggies in the large pan.
Cover and cook on medium-low for 35 - 40 minutes. Careful NOT to stir at any point, otherwise the veggies will turn into mush. Serve with the garlic yogurt drizzled over top, and with toasted bread and salata on the side. Enjoy!
Storage
Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days.
The garlic yogurt is best enjoyed immediately, but can be stored in a container in the fridge for up to 1 day.

Aushak - Afghan Dumplings
Servings: 40
Ingredients
Aushak filling
2 leeks†
1 Tbsp (15 mL) vegetable oil
2 tsp (12 g) salt
12 stalks green onion, thinly sliced‡
1 tsp (3 g) chili powder
¼ tsp ground black pepper
40 vegan round dumpling wrappers
Garlic yogurt sauce
2 cups (480 mL) unsweetened soy yogurt
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 tsp (1 g) dried mint leaves (optional)
½ tsp salt
Gheymeh (tomato 'meat') sauce
¼ cup (60 mL) vegetable oil
1 medium yellow onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced (optional)
1 green chili pepper, seeds removed, minced
2 tsp (4 g) ground coriander
2 tsp (5 g) paprika powder
1 tsp (6 g) salt
½ tsp ground black pepper
1½ cups (170 g) soy veggie ground
1 cup (240 mL) water
¼ cup (66 g) tomato paste
Optional garnishes
dried mint leaves
fresh cilantro
fresh mint leaf
Directions
Slice the leeks in half lengthwise and wash in between the layers. Very thinly slice the white and light green portions of the leeks. The thinner you can slice this the better.
In a large strainer over a bowl, combine the leeks, oil, and salt. Mix together using your hands, massaging to ensure the leeks are well coated. Allow the mixture to sit for 5 minutes to soften.
Using your hands, squeeze the mixture to strain any excess liquid, and then add the green onions, chili powder, and pepper over top the leeks. Mix and set aside.
To make the yogurt sauce, combine the yogurt, garlic, mint, and salt in a bowl. Set aside.
To make the gheymeh, heat the oil in a large pan on medium-high heat. Cook the onions until golden, about 5 minutes.
Add the garlic, chili pepper, coriander, paprika, salt, and pepper and stir for 1 minute to toast.
Add the veggie ground, water, and tomato paste. Mix and cook until heated through, about 4 - 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and keep covered with a lid.
To make the aushak, take a wrapper, place 1 Tbsp of filling in the center. Wet the edges with some water and fold the wrapper in half, over the filling.
Use your fingers to press out any extra air from the filling pocket and firmly pinch the edges to ensure the aushak is well sealed*.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add 1 - 2 Tbsp oil to the water to help keep the aushak from sticking to each other. Working in batches, gently drop about 10 aushak in the water but don't overcrowd the pot. Cook for 4 - 5 minutes.
Scoop out the cooked aushak and place in a lightly greased colander. Bring the pot of water back to a boil, and continue to cook the remaining aushak.
To serve, smear a couple of spoonfuls of yogurt on a few serving dishes. Place 1 - 2 layers of the cooked aushak on top.
Cover the aushak with some more yogurt and gheymeh. Continue this process over several serving dishes.
Garnish with fresh mint or cilantro, and enjoy!
Notes
† Approximately 5 cups of chopped leeks.
‡ Approximately 2 cups of sliced green onion per 12 stalks.
* Make-ahead: the aushak can be made ahead of time and frozen in a single layer on a parchment-lined plate. When frozen, transferred to an airtight container and keep in the freezer until ready to use.
Storage
This dish is best enjoyed immediately.
Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 days, although best to store each component of the dish separately if possible.
Frozen aushak can be stored in the freezer for up to 2 months. When ready to enjoy, cook in boiling water as outlined in the directions.
 
Bolani - Afghan Stuffed Flatbread
Servings: 8
Ingredients
Dough
1 cup (240 mL) lukewarm water
1½ Tbsp (22 mL) vegetable oil
1½ tsp (9 g) salt
½ tsp active dry yeast
3 cups + 1 Tbsp (420 g) bread flour
Filling
2 large potatoes, peeled, cut into 1 cm cubes
6 stalks green onion, sliced †
1 cup (16 g) fresh cilantro, chopped
1 green chili pepper, minced
1 tsp (2 g) ground coriander
1 tsp (6 g) salt
½ tsp ground turmeric
½ tsp ground black pepper
2½ Tbsp (37 mL) vegetable oil, for frying, divided
Serves well with
Afghan green chutney
Directions
To a large bowl, add the water, oil, salt, and yeast. Stir, and then add the flour. Mix well.
Then knead the dough* for 3 minutes, or until soft and elastic. Add a little more flour as needed if the dough feels too sticky to work with. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes at room temperature while preparing the filling.
Cook the potatoes in a large pot of boiling water for 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are fully cooked through. Then drain.
To a large bowl, add the drained potatoes, green onion, cilantro, chili, ground coriander, salt, turmeric, and pepper. Use a fork or potato masher to mash everything. It's okay if a few lumps remain.
Cut the dough into 8 pieces.
Roll each piece into a ball with your hands. Dust each ball with flour.
Sprinkle some flour on your working surface and use a rolling pin to roll each ball into a thin circle with a diameter of roughly 20 - 22 cm. We're aiming for a thickness similar to that of a tortilla. The thinner the better, but not so thin that it will rip if handled.
Before adding the filling, gently lift the rolled-out dough and heavily re-flour your working surface. Spread ⅓ of a cup of the potato filling over half of the dough, leaving a ½ inch (1 cm) border along the edge. Dip your fingers in water and spread the water along this edge, only on one half of the circle.
Fold the dough in half, over the filling, to create a half-moon shape. Press out all the air bubbles, then pinch the edges with your fingers to fully seal the bolani.
Add 1 tsp (5 mL) of oil to a large pan over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the bolani to the pan. Let cook for 2 - 3 minutes or until the bottom is golden. Meanwhile, use a silicone pastry brush to brush some more oil on top of the bolani.
When the bottom is golden, flip, and let cook on the other side until golden. Then transfer to a cooling rack.
Cut the bolani in triangles and serve with green chutney. Enjoy!
Notes
† Approximately 1 cup of sliced green onion per 6 stalks.
* This recipe can be massively sped up if you'd prefer not to make your own homemade dough. Growing up, my mum simply placed the potato filling inside of tortilla wraps and folded them in half, then fried them in a bit of oil. Easy-peasy!
Storage
Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days.
 
Borani Banjan - Afghan Eggplant Dish
Servings: 8
Ingredients
4 small eggplants†
1¼ cups (300 mL) vegetable oil‡
4 cloves garlic, crushed
2 green chili peppers, sliced lengthwise
3 medium tomatoes, chopped
2 Tbsp (33 g) tomato paste
½ tsp ground turmeric
1 tsp (6 g) salt
1 medium yellow onion, sliced into ½ cm thick rounds
2 medium tomatoes, cut into 1 cm thick rounds
Garlic yogurt sauce
1 cup (240 mL) unsweetened soy yogurt
2 cloves garlic, crushed
½ tsp salt
Serves well with
salata (Afghan salad)
whole wheat pita bread
Directions
Peel the eggplants. Cut them through the middle horizontally and then slice them into 1 cm thick planks. Heat the oil in a sauté pan over high heat.
When the oil is hot, carefully add a few eggplant slices. Cook until golden, about 2 - 3 min per side. Transfer the fried eggplant to a strainer set over a bowl to allow any excess oil to drain. Repeat until all the eggplants are cooked.
There should be leftover oil in the pan after frying the eggplant. For the following steps, we will need ¼ cup (60 ml) of oil*. Reduce the temperature to medium. Add the garlic (careful as it may splatter). Cook until fragrant and golden, about 30 seconds. Stir throughout.
Add the green pepper, chopped tomatoes, tomato paste, turmeric, and salt. Stir and cook for another 1 - 2 minutes.
Drop the heat to medium-low. Place the sliced onion over the sauce in a single layer. Then lay half the eggplant over the onions, layer the tomato slices over that, and finish with the remaining eggplant slices. Cover the pan and cook until the onions are soft, about 20 minutes**.
Meanwhile, make the sauce by combining the yogurt, garlic, and salt in a small bowl.
Add some of the yogurt sauce to the base of a serving dish. Then scoop up the eggplant, tomato, and onion mixture and transfer it to the dish. Remove the peppers from the bottom of the pan and place them decoratively on top. Scoop up any remaining sauce and drizzle over the dish.
Finish with another drizzle of yogurt sauce, dried mint, and paprika powder for garnish. Serve with bread and enjoy!
Notes
† Preferably, use the dark purple variety of eggplants, also known as the globe eggplants.
‡ If you'd prefer to use less oil, try our "Kichaloo Banjan" recipe.
* If there is more than that, carefully scoop some oil out. If there is less than that, add a bit more oil to the pan.
** Try not to stir, if possible, so that the onion and tomatoes retain some of their shape, otherwise they get "mushy".
Storage
This dish is best the day it's made.
Store leftover Banjan and yogurt sauce separately in airtight containers in the fridge for up to 3 days.
 
Afghan Green Chutney
Servings: 16
Ingredients
3 cups (48 g) fresh parsley, packed, washed
3 cups (48 g) fresh cilantro, packed, washed
5 cloves garlic
½ cup (50 g) raw walnuts
3 green chili peppers, seeds removed (fewer if you prefer less spice)
1 tsp (6 g) salt
¼ tsp ground black pepper
1 cup (240 mL) white vinegar
Serves well with
bolani - Afghan stuffed flatbread
Directions
To a large food processor, add the parsley, cilantro, garlic, walnuts, chili peppers, salt, and pepper. Blend until minced, but be careful not to purée.
Finally, add the vinegar and pulse 2 - 3 times, or simply stir the vinegar in with a spoon.
Transfer to a mason jar, filling it no more than ¾ full. Don't cover with a lid yet, as we want to let the chutney 'breathe' overnight* while in the fridge.
The next day, seal the jar. If using a metal lid, wrap the lid with plastic wrap first so the metal does not rust and leach into the jar. Enjoy!
Notes
* When covered too soon, the chutney can sometimes bubble out of the jar, making a mess. If you prefer to still cover it while it's in the fridge, we advise opening the lid every 4 - 6 hours on the first day to let the jar "burp".
Variations: you can add fresh mint leaves, fresh ginger, ground turmeric, cumin seeds, or some sugar if desired to vary the flavours.
Storage
Store in an glass jar in the fridge for up to 4 months.

Shola - Afghan Savoury Sticky Rice
Servings: 8
Ingredients
Mung bean rice
¼ cup (60 mL) vegetable oil
2 medium yellow onions, chopped
2 cloves garlic, crushed
2 Tbsp (33 g) tomato paste
1½ tsp (3 g) paprika powder
1 tsp (3 g) ground turmeric
1 tsp (2 g) ground cumin
¼ tsp ground black pepper
5 cups (1200 mL) water
1 cup (207 g) dry mung beans, soaked overnight
2½ cups (500 g) uncooked short-grain white rice, rinsed
¼ cup (12 g) dried dill
1½ tsp (9 g) salt
Gheymeh - tomato sauce topping
1 cup (190 g) dry split yellow chickpeas, soaked overnight†
¼ cup (60 mL) vegetable oil
2 medium yellow onions, chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced (optional)
2 Tbsp (33 g) tomato paste
2 tsp (12 g) salt
1 tsp (3 g) ground turmeric
1 tsp (2 g) ground black pepper
¼ cup (60 mL) water
Garlic yogurt sauce
1 cup (240 mL) unsweetened soy yogurt
2 cloves garlic, crushed
½ tsp salt
Serves well with
banjan - Afghan eggplant dish
salata (Afghan salad)
Optional garnishes
dried mint leaves
fresh dill
paprika powder
Directions
To a large pot, add the drained split chickpeas and cover with 8 cups (2 L) of water. Bring to a boil, reduce to a rapid simmer, and cook for 30 - 60 minutes, or until the split chickpeas are fully cooked through*. Then drain.
Meanwhile, make the flavoured rice. Add the oil to a large pot over medium-high heat and cook the onions until golden.
Add the garlic and tomato paste and cook for 30 seconds, stirring throughout.
Add the paprika, turmeric, cumin, and pepper. Stir for about 1 more minute to toast the spices.
Then add the water and drained mung beans. Partially cover and cook for 20 - 25 minutes at a gentle simmer. Then scoop a mung bean out of the pot and pinch it between your fingers. When it's about 50% cooked, soft on the outside but still a bit firm in the middle, move onto the next step.
Add the rice, dried dill, and salt, stir. Make sure there is 1 inch (2 cm) of liquid above the rice. If not, add more water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover with a lid and cook for 20 minutes. Stir periodically.
To make the gheymeh, add the oil to a saucepan on medium-high heat. When hot, cook the onions for 5 - 7 minutes, or until golden.
Add the garlic, tomato paste, salt, turmeric, and pepper. Cook for 1 minute, stirring throughout. Then add the drained cooked split chickpeas, and ¼ cup (60 mL) water. Bring to a boil, then cover and turn off the heat.
Returning to the rice, when it’s cooked through, wrap a clean kitchen cloth around the lid of the pot and cover, allowing the rice and beans to steam for an additional 10 minutes on very low heat. This helps to ensure that all the rice and mung beans are ultra-soft.
To make the yogurt sauce, combine the yogurt, garlic, and salt in a small bowl.
To assemble the dish, scoop a generous serving of the rice into a serving dish. Top with some of the gheymeh.
Add a generous drizzle of the yogurt sauce, garnish, and enjoy!
Notes
† Speed-it-up: split chickpeas are also known as chana dal or split yellow peas. To speed up this recipe, you can substitute the split chickpeas for brown or green lentils. In this case, the cooking time is significantly reduced, down to about 20 minutes.
* The cooking time can vary drastically depending on the source and brand. Continue to check on them and cook until completely soft into the centre.
Storage
Store the rice and gheymeh in airtight containers in the fridge for up to 4 days.
The yogurt sauce is best enjoyed immediately, otherwise it's best to store separately from the rice in the fridge for up to 2 days. Note that the sauce will curdle, and that's normal. Simply stir for it to become smooth again.
 
Salata - Afghan Salad
Servings: 2
Ingredients
2 medium tomatoes, finely chopped

½ lime, juiced
1 tsp (1 g) dried mint leaves (optional)
¼ tsp salt
Serves well with
banjan - Afghan eggplant dish
Directions
Add all of the ingredients to a bowl, toss, and enjoy!
Storage
The salata is best enjoyed immediately, as the salt causes the tomato and cucumber to release their water content rather quickly.
Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container stored in the fridge for up to 1 day.
 
Shir Berinj - Afghan Rice Pudding
Servings: 4
Ingredients
1 cup (200 g) uncooked short-grain white rice, washed, soaked 4 hours†
¼ cup (60 mL) water
3 cups (720 mL) unsweetened oat milk
¼ cup (56 g) granulated sugar
2 Tbsp (30 mL) rose water‡
¼ tsp ground cardamom
Optional garnish
dried red rose petals
ground cinnamon
roasted unsalted pistachios
Directions
To a saucepan on medium-high heat, add the drained rice and water. Let the rice soak up all the water while stirring occasionally, this will take about 5 minutes.
Add the oat milk, bring the milk to a very light simmer and cook uncovered for 20 - 25 minutes, stirring every few minutes. Stir occasionally.
When the rice is cooked, add the sugar and cook for 2 more minutes. Make sure to keep an eye on it, as the sugar can burn quickly.
Remove the pan from the heat, stir in the rosewater and cardamom, and allow it to cool off completely. Garnish with cinnamon**, rose petals, and pistachios, and enjoy!
Notes
† Traditionally the rice is soaked. If not soaked, simply add more milk. For every 1 cup of dry rice, 4 cups of milk should do the trick.
‡ Rosewater is a common ingredient in some Middle Eastern cuisines and gives the recipe a floral taste. You might find it in your local Asian supermarket. If you’re not accustomed to the taste, consider adding less to start.
** Cinnamon is traditionally only added to the top decoratively, but as a kid, I preferred it when my mum mixed it into my rice while it was cooking. You're welcome to do the same if you're also a cinnamon lover!
Storage
Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.
 
Kitchiri - Herati Afghan Rice
Servings: 4
Ingredients
½ cup (100 g) dry split mung beans, soaked overnight†
1 cup (200 g) uncooked basmati rice, soaked overnight
¼ cup (60 mL) vegetable oil
1 medium onion, grated or minced
1 tsp (2 g) ground cumin
½ tsp ground turmeric
½ tsp salt
½ tsp ground black pepper
1 cup (240 mL) water, plus more for the rice
Garlic yogurt sauce
½ cup (120 mL) unsweetened soy yogurt
1 clove garlic, crushed
¼ tsp salt
Optional garnish
fresh cilantro
Serves well with
banjan - Afghan eggplant dish
salata (Afghan salad)
Directions
After an overnight soak, much of the skin separates from the mung beans. Traditionally, the skin is scooped out before cooking, but this is optional. Rinse and drain both the mung beans and rice.
Heat the oil in a large pot on medium heat. When hot, add the onions and cook until very golden, about 10 - 12 minutes. We want the onions a deep brown but without burning them.
Then add the drained mung beans, increase the heat to medium-high, and cook for 3 - 4 minutes to lightly toast. Stir often.
Add the spices and cook for 1 more minute, stirring throughout.
Add the water and cook for 3 minutes, or until boiling.
Add the rice and cover it with enough water so that the water is about ½ inch (2 cm) above the rice*. Bring to a boil, partially cover, reduce to a gentle simmer, and cook for 15 - 20 minutes.
To make the garlic yogurt sauce, combine the yogurt, garlic, and salt in a small bowl. Set aside until ready to serve.
Returning to the rice, remove the lid, mix the cooked rice to fluff it, then use the end of a wooden spatula to create 5 holes in the rice.
Taste test. If the rice is not yet cooked, add a small splash of water. Then wrap the lid of the pot with a clean dish towel and place this over the pot. Let sit for 5 - 7 minutes on low heat.
To serve, top the rice with a drizzle of the garlic yogurt sauce. Enjoy!
Notes
† Find split mung beans at your local Persian grocery store. You can use whole mung beans instead as well, but they should be soaked overnight and then cooked in the boiling water for 8 - 10 minutes before the rice is added, to ensure that the rice and beans are done cooking at the same time. When the soaked mung beans are rinsed, the skins should come off.
* Careful to not add too much water, as more water can always be added later.
Storage
Keep the kitchari separate from the garlic yogurt in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.
 
Chickpea and Rice Tortilla Soup
Servings: 4
Ingredients
Soup
1 Tbsp (15 mL) vegetable oil
1 medium onion, finely chopped
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 cups (480 g) canned diced tomatoes
2 Tbsp (18 g) burrito seasoning
6 cups (1440 mL) boiling water
2 vegetable bouillon cubes, crushed
2½ cups (410 g) cooked chickpeas
¾ cup (150 g) uncooked white rice, rinsed
¼ tsp salt, plus more to taste
¼ tsp ground black pepper, plus more to taste
Tortilla chips
4 large soft tortillas
1 Tbsp (15 mL) vegetable oil
½ tsp salt
⅛ tsp ground black pepper
Optional garnish
fresh cilantro
lemon slice
sliced chili pepper
Directions
Heat a large pot over medium-high heat and add the oil, onion, and garlic. Give it a stir and let it cook for 2 - 3 minutes, or until translucent.
Add the tomatoes and burrito spice mix and let it cook for another 2 minutes. Stir occasionally. Next, add in the water, bouillon cube, chickpeas, rice, salt, and pepper. Stir.
Bring the soup to a simmer and let it cook uncovered for 15 - 20 minutes, or until the rice is fully cooked. Next, preheat the oven to 390°F (200°C) and line a baking tray with parchment paper.
Cut each tortilla into 12 pieces and transfer the pieces to a large bowl. Pour the oil, salt, and pepper over the tortillas. Toss and massage with your hands to coat.
Lay the pieces in a single layer over one or two parchment-lined baking trays*.
Bake in the oven on the middle and lowest rack for 3 - 4 minutes. Then flip the tortillas over and return to the oven to bake for another 3 - 4 minutes. Remove from the oven when the edges of the chips are toasted. Keep an eye on them during baking because they can easily over toast.
When the soup is done, serve with the baked tortilla chips. Enjoy!
Notes
* Crowding all the pitas onto one tray can cause the chips to steam rather than roast, which might prevent them from getting crispy.
Storage
The soup can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days.
The tortilla chips can be stored in a container on the counter for up to 3 days.

To a separate large lined baking tray, add the potatoes, carrots, unpeeled garlic, oil, and burrito seasoning. Toss to coat. Roast both trays for 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, place the frozen peas in a medium bowl and cover them with plenty of boiling water. Let sit for 10 minutes.
Remove the trays from the oven and stir. To the veggie tray, add the onion wedges. Return the trays to the oven with their positions swapped, and roast for an additional 15 - 25 minutes, or until cooked to your liking.
Drain the peas and mash with a fork, then add the yogurt, salt, and pepper to the peas and mix.
When the roasted garlic is cool enough to handle, peel and mash the cloves with a fork. Add this to the yogurt sauce. Mix. For a smoother consistency, blend the yogurt sauce with an immersion blender, although this is optional. Taste test and add more salt if desired.
To assemble, divide the spinach between bowls. Top with the roasted veggies and chickpeas. Add a dollop of the pea yogurt sauce before digging in. Enjoy!
Notes
† Nutrition tip: aim to use plant-based yogurt/milk (choose one) that is fortified with calcium.
Storage
The assembled salad is best enjoyed immediately.
The roasted vegetables and yogurt dressing can be stored separately in airtight containers in the fridge for up to 4 days.
The chickpeas can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge or at room temperature for up to 3 days. Note, they will likely lose their crispiness if not enjoyed immediately. To make re-crispy, simply toast in the oven for a few minutes if desired.

Ingredients
Lentil potato patties
2 medium potatoes, peeled, cut into 2 cm cubes
½ cup (96 g) dry green lentils, rinsed
1 Tbsp (6 g) roti masala seasoning†
½ tsp salt
¼ tsp ground black pepper
Wrap assembly
2 tsp (10 mL) vegetable oil
3 carrots, thinly sliced into strips

Vegan Sweetened Condensed Milk
Servings: 16
Ingredients
1½ cups (360 mL) canned full-fat coconut milk†
½ cup (112 g) granulated sugar
Use this to make
sweetened condensed milk iced coffee
Directions
Add the coconut milk and sugar to a heavy-bottomed* saucepan. Bring to a gentle boil over medium-high heat while stirring occasionally.
Turn the heat to low, and let the milk very gently simmer for 45 minutes. Be careful to not let it simmer too aggressively. Give it a stir every 5 - 10 minutes. The mixture should reduce in volume by about half in that time.
The condensed milk is ready when it has slightly thickened but is still pourable. When a spoon is dipped into the mixture, it should leave a thin layer on the spoon when the spoon is lifted out of the saucepan. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.
Transfer the condensed coconut milk to a sterilized jar to fully cool off. Transfer to the fridge for at least one hour, it will thicken more in the fridge as it cools**. Enjoy!
Notes
† We recommend using a coconut milk can that has no emulsifier (such as guar gum) in the ingredient list. We've found this results in a condensed milk with a more desirable and homogeneous consistency.
* A heavy-bottomed pot is thicker at the base and will absorb and distribute the heat more evenly. It's less prone to hot spots, which means there's less chance the condensed milk will burn.
** Out of the fridge, you may notice your condensed milk is thinner or thicker than the one pictured. This is normal and may depend on different factors, such as the fat content of the coconut milk used, or the intensity at which the mixture was simmering on the stove.
Storage
The sweetened condensed coconut milk can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days.
 
Sweetened Condensed Milk Iced Coffee
Servings: 2
Ingredients
⅓ cup (80 mL) brewed espresso
¼ cup (60 mL) sweetened condensed coconut milk
2 cups (222 g) ice cubes
1 cup (240 mL) unsweetened oat milk
Directions
In a cup or glass, mix together the freshly brewed espresso with the condensed coconut milk. Stir together while the espresso is hot, so the condensed milk fully dissolves.
Divide the ice cubes and espresso mix between the glasses.
Top each drink with the oat milk, give it a stir, and enjoy!
Storage
Best when enjoyed immediately.
 
Coconut Vanilla Iced Coffee with Coffee Whip
Servings: 2
Ingredients
1 cup (240 mL) strong pour-over coffee
3 cups (720 mL) unsweetened coconut milk beverage
2 tsp (10 mL) pure vanilla extract
¼ cup (60 mL) hot water
¼ cup (56 g) granulated sugar
2 tsp (4 g) espresso powder
Directions
Pour the brewed coffee into an ice cube tray and freeze. In a pitcher, combine the coconut milk and vanilla. Store in the fridge until ready to use.
In a large bowl, add the water, sugar and espresso powder and whip with a electric hand mixer for 4 - 5 minutes or until soft peaks form. Alternatively, you could also whip it by hand using a whisk which will take about 8 - 12 minutes.
To serve, add the coffee ice cubes to a glass. Fill half the cup with the vanilla milk, and top the other half with whipped coffee*. Stir and enjoy.
Notes
* The coffee whip can be re-whipped, if it's starting to deflate before it's served.
Storage
The coffee ice cubes can be stored in the freezer in the ice cube tray for up to a week, or remove from the tray and keep in an airtight container or bag in the freezer for up to 1 month.
The vanilla coconut milk can be stored in the container for up to 3 days.
 
Cold Brew Coffee with Vanilla Cream
Servings: 6
Ingredients
Cold brew concentrate
1 cup (80 g) whole coffee beans
3 cups (720 mL) water, room temperature or cold
Vanilla cream
1 cup (240 mL) vegan whipping cream†
½ cup (120 mL) unsweetened soy milk
1 Tbsp (15 mL) pure vanilla extract
1 Tbsp (15 mL) agave syrup
Final touches
1½ cups (360 mL) cold water
1¼ cups (139 g) ice cubes
Directions
Grind the coffee beans to a medium-coarse consistency.
In a French press or large mason jar, combine the coffee grinds and water. Stir and top with the lid. Steep at room temperature or in the fridge for 12 - 24 hours. The longer it sits, the stronger the coffee taste.
To make the vanilla cream, combine the cream, soy milk, vanilla, and agave syrup in a separate jar, and store in the fridge until ready to use.
The next day, place a strainer over a bowl lined with cheese cloth (or nut milk bag). Strain the grounds through the cheesecloth. If desired, filter the coffee through a second time to remove any residual ground beans. The liquid that remains in the bowl is now your cold brew coffee concentrate!
To make the drink, fill a glass with ice. Then pour in 2 parts cold brew concentrate, 1 part cold water, and 1 part vanilla cream. Stir and enjoy!
Notes
† We used a 23% fat soy-based liquid cream used to traditionally make whipped cream.
Storage
The cold brew concentrate can be kept in the fridge in a large glass container for up to 1 week.
The vanilla cream can also be stored in the fridge for up to 5 days.
 
Cereal Crunch Frozen Yogurt Breakfast Bars
Servings: 9
Ingredients
1 cup (240 mL) peanut butter

1 cup (14 g) puffed rice
1½ cups (46 g) bran flakes with red berries‡
½ cup (80 g) dried cranberries, minced
1 cup (240 mL) unsweetened soy yogurt††
3 Tbsp (5 g) freeze-dried strawberries, roughly chopped (optional)‡‡
1 tsp (2 g) lemon zest (optional)
Directions
In a food processor, combine the peanut butter, dates, milk, and flaxseed until a soft dough forms.
Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and add the puffed rice, cereal flakes, and cranberries. Gently mix until combined.
Line an 8 x 8 inch (20 x 20 cm) baking dish with parchment paper. Transfer the mixture to the prepared dish and firmly press down on it using the back of a spoon or your hands*.
Pour the yogurt over the base and sprinkle it with freeze-dried strawberries and lemon zest. Place the dish in the freezer for at least 3 hours, or until the yogurt is frozen**.
Remove from the freezer and let it come to room temperature for about 5 minutes to soften slightly so that it cuts more easily. Cut into bars and transfer to an airtight container, using pieces of parchment to separate the pieces.
Store in the freezer until ready to eat. Before enjoying, let your bar thaw slightly so that the yogurt softens.
Notes
† Nutrition tip: aim to use plant-based milk that is fortified with calcium.
‡ Ideally choose a cereal that is low in sugar, as we are already naturally sweetening our bars with dates and dried cranberries.
†† Nutrition tip: aim to use plant-based yogurt that is fortified with calcium.
‡‡ We picked the freeze-dried berries out of our cereal box.
* The more tightly packed you can make it, the better the bars will hold together when ready to enjoy.
** The yogurt may turn a yellow colour in the freezer. That's normal and it'll return to its original colour if it sits in the fridge or at room temperature.
Storage
These bars can be stored in the freezer in an airtight container for up to 1 month.
 
Double Chocolate Granola
Servings: 9
Ingredients
2 cups (162 g) rolled oats
½ cup (72 g) raw pumpkin seeds
½ cup (62 g) raw sunflower seeds
½ cup (50 g) raw walnuts
½ cup (50 g) raw pecans
⅓ cup (35 g) Dutch processed cocoa powder
¼ cup (19 g) unsweetened shredded coconut
2 Tbsp (21 g) whole chia seeds
½ tsp salt
½ cup (120 mL) maple syrup
¼ cup (54 g) refined coconut oil, melted†
1 tsp (5 mL) pure vanilla extract (optional)
1.8 oz (50 g) dairy-free dark chocolate, roughly chopped
Directions
Preheat the oven to 340°F (170°C) and line a baking tray with a piece of parchment paper.
To a food processor, add the oats, pumpkin and sunflower seeds, walnuts, pecans, cocoa, coconut, chia seeds, and salt. Give it a few pulses to roughly chop the oats, seeds and nuts. If you don't have a food processor, you can also coarsely chop the nuts and seeds with a knife.
Remove the blade from the food processor. If the blades can't be removed, transfer the contents to a large bowl instead. Add the maple syrup, coconut oil, and vanilla and mix using a rubber spatula.
Transfer the mixture to the baking tray and spread it out evenly. Let the granola bake in the oven on the centre rack for 20 - 22 minutes, stirring halfway to ensure even baking.
Remove from the oven and allow the granola to cool completely. It will harden as it cools. Once completely cool, mix in the chocolate chunks, and enjoy with milk or yogurt and fresh fruit.
Notes
† Refined coconut oil is coconut oil that doesn't smell or taste like coconuts. If you prefer a distinct coconut taste, use unrefined coconut oil instead.
Storage
Store the granola in an airtight container or large glass storage jar in a cool and dry place for up to 3 weeks.
 
Baked Tortilla Chips
Servings: 6
Ingredients
4 large soft tortillas
1½ Tbsp (22 mL) vegetable oil
½ tsp salt
¼ tsp paprika powder
⅛ tsp ground black pepper
Directions
Preheat the oven to 390°F (200°C). Cut each tortilla into 12 pieces and transfer the pieces to a large bowl.
Pour half the oil over the tortillas, toss, then add the remaining oil*. Toss again. Sprinkle over the salt, paprika, and pepper and mix again, ensuring all pieces have some seasoning on them.
Lay the pieces in a single layer* over two lined baking trays. Bake in the oven on the middle and lowest rack for 3 - 4 minutes. Rotate the pans and bake for another 3 - 4 minutes.
Remove from the oven when the edges of the chips are toasted. Keep an eye on them during baking because they can easily over toast.
Serve the chips with your favourite salsa, dip or spread and enjoy!
Notes
* Adding the oil in parts helps to ensure that it's evenly distributed between the pieces.
* Crowding all the pitas onto one tray can cause the chips to steam rather than roast, which might prevent them from getting crispy.
Storage
Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.
If they start to lose their crispness, re-toast in the oven for 1 - 2 minutes.

medium white onion
Directions
To a large pan on medium-high heat add the oil and onions. Cook for 5 - 7 minutes, or until the onions are golden.
Next, add the garlic, cumin, paprika, bouillon cube, cayenne, and black pepper. Cook for 1 minute, breaking up the bouillon cube and letting the spices get fragrant and toasted.
Add the beans, water, and chipotle. Stir and simmer uncovered on medium heat for 10 minutes.
Transfer half of the cooked bean mixture to a tall container or bowl and blend with a immersion blender. Alternatively, blend in a regular standing blender until creamy and smooth. This step is optional.
Use a wooden spoon to roughly mash the remaining beans in the pan, leaving some texture.
Add the blended portion of the beans back into the pan of mashed beans, along with the lime juice and stir to combine.
Allow it to slightly cool before serving. Top with fresh cilantro and chopped onions if desired. Enjoy!
Notes
† Reduce the amount of water for a thicker spread that's more suitable for wraps.
‡ The chipotle sauce we use is a blend of chipotle peppers with water, vinegar, and spices. We do not recommend using a mayo-based chipotle sauce in this recipe.
Storage
This recipe keeps in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.

Make-Ahead Freezer Burritos
Servings: 6
Ingredients
1½ cups (170 g) soy veggie ground
2 Tbsp (17 g) Mexican spice mix
6 large soft tortillas
2⅓ cups (555 g) refried beans
2 red bell peppers, diced
2 stalks green onion, sliced
1¼ cups (206 g) canned corn, drained
½ cup (8 g) fresh cilantro (optional)
½ cup (68 g) black olives, sliced
½ cup (75 g) pickled jalapeños, sliced
Serves well with
avocado
hot sauce
quick guacamole
salsa
Directions
Preheat an oven to 350°F (180°C). Mix together the veggie ground and spice mix in a bowl.
Spread a heaping ⅓ cup of refried beans over half of a wrap. Sprinkle ¼ cup of the veggie ground mix overtop of that.
Add the remaining ingredients to the wraps: the bell pepper, green onions, corn, cilantro, olives, and jalapeños*.
Fold in each side of the wrap, then roll, starting from the closest edge, until the wrap is closed. Place seam-side down on a baking tray. Repeat with the remaining wraps.
Bake in the oven for 7 - 10 minutes, or until the wraps are lightly golden. Optionally, if after 10 minutes they aren't yet golden, turn on the broiler and grill them for a minute. Keep your eye on them so they don't burn.
Allow the wraps to cool to room temperature before freezing.
To reheat, remove from the freezer and let thaw**. Reheat the burrito in the microwave (on 400W or lower), oven at 390°F (200°C), or on the stove in a non-stick pan covered with a lid. Reheating will generally take 4 - 5 minutes.
Serve with avocado slices or desired sauces, and enjoy!
Notes
* If adding other toppings, note some don't freeze well, like tofu, tomatoes, and lettuce. Instead, add those as fresh toppings on the day you're eating the wrap.
** A slightly thawed wrap will reheat faster than a frozen solid wrap.
Storage
Keep in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 days.
Store in the freezer for up to 2 months. When storing in the freezer, make sure to wrap them in parchment paper so they don't stick together or to the sides of the storage container.

Add the vegan parmesan ingredients to a small food processor and blend into a coarse sand. Alternatively, mince the cashews with a knife and mix the ingredients together in a bowl.
Preheat a griddle pan on high heat. Cut the romaine lettuce heads in half lengthwise*. Lightly brush olive oil over the cut sides. Place the heads cut-side down on the pan for 10 - 15 seconds, or until there are light grill marks on the lettuce, then remove from the heat.
To assemble, place the lettuce heads grilled-side up on a platter. Drizzle over some dressing, and add a sprinkle of croutons and vegan parmesan. Serve the remaining dressing, croutons, and parmesan on the side. Enjoy!
Notes
† If the cashews are unsoaked, cover with boiling water and let sit for at least 15 minutes.
* The lettuce heads must be completely dry when grilling! Any water droplets will cause the lettuce to steam rather than sear, resulting in wilted lettuce.
Storage
The salad is best enjoyed immediately.
The dressing will keep in the fridge for up to 4 days.
The vegan parmesan will keep in the fridge for up to 1 week.

You can also use enjoy this "feta" straight out of the blender as a dip or spread. Have it with toast, crackers, or cut-up vegetables. The longer it sits in the fridge, the more crumbly and "feta-like" the texture becomes.
Storage
Store in an airtight container for up to 5 days.

Vanilla Caramel Cake
Servings: 12
Ingredients
Caramel sauce
⅓ cup (75 g) unsalted margarine
⅓ cup (73 g) brown sugar
⅓ cup (80 mL) coconut cream†
2 Tbsp (30 mL) maple syrup
¼ tsp salt
¼ tsp pure vanilla extract
Cake
2 cups (480 mL) unsweetened soy milk‡
1½ Tbsp (22 mL) apple cider vinegar
3 cups (414 g) all-purpose flour
1½ cups (336 g) granulated sugar
1 Tbsp (10 g) baking powder
1 tsp (5 g) baking soda
½ tsp salt
⅔ cup (145 g) refined coconut oil, melted, at room temperature††
1½ Tbsp (22 mL) pure vanilla extract
Frosting
7.9 oz (224 g) unsalted vegan butter, at room temperature
2 cups (268 g) powdered sugar
1 tsp (5 mL) pure vanilla extract
Optional garnish
fresh mixed berries
Directions
Start by making the caramel sauce. Add all the ingredients except for the vanilla to a saucepan. Stir continuously while bringing it to a boil, then reduce to a simmer, cooking uncovered for 8 - 10 minutes to allow the sauce to thicken. Stir occasionally to prevent burning.
Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Allow the caramel sauce to sit and cool; it will continue to thicken as it cools, and thickens even more once refrigerated.
Grease two 8-inch (20 cm) round cake pans with oil and line the bottom with a cut-out round piece of parchment paper. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
To a medium bowl, add the milk and vinegar, and give it a mix. It'll start to curdle, creating vegan buttermilk.
Place a sieve over a large bowl, sift all the dry ingredients through it: the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix, and then create a shallow well in the middle.
Returning to the medium bowl, add the melted coconut oil and vanilla extract.
Add the wet ingredients to the large bowl with the dry ingredients, and mix until just combined.
Divide the batter between the two greased baking pans, and give the pans a gentle tap on the counter to release any air bubbles.
Bake the cakes on the middle rack of the preheated oven for 33 - 35 minutes, or until the edges are golden and a thin wooden skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.
Meanwhile, make the frosting by adding the butter to a large bowl. Use an electric electric hand mixer to mix the butter until fluffy, about 5 minutes.
Place a sieve over the bowl, sift in ½ cup of icing sugar at a time, and beat until it's all incorporated.
Add the vanilla extract and ¼ cup of the caramel sauce made in step #1 (reserve the remainder for garnish). Beat until combined.
When the cakes are done, remove them from the oven and let them cool for 10 minutes in the cake pan before transferring to a cooling rack to let them cool off completely.
If you like, you can level your cakes with a serrated knife to create a flat surface for stacking the cakes on top of each other.
Drizzle 2 Tbsp of caramel sauce on one of the cakes, and using a spatula or butter knife, spread out about 1 cup of frosting on it.
Place the second cake on top and drizzle with another 2 Tbsp of caramel sauce and frost with the leftover frosting. Smooth out the frosting on the top and sides of the cakes.
Optionally, spoon the leftover caramel sauce on top of the cake and let it drip down the sides. Top with some berries if desired and enjoy!
Notes
† Coconut cream is the thick part of a can of coconut milk. To more easily obtain the cream, refrigerate the can overnight.
‡ We recommend using either soy or pea milk for this recipe, as the high protein content of these milks are what allows the milk to curdle to create vegan buttermilk. We can't guarantee other plant-based milk will be successful.
†† Refined coconut oil is coconut oil that doesn't smell or taste like coconuts. If you prefer a distinct coconut taste, use unrefined coconut oil instead.
Storage
Best if enjoyed immediately.
Store the whole cake in the fridge for up to 1 - 2 days.
Store leftovers an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.
 
Raspberry Rose Chocolate Bark
Servings: 16
Ingredients
3 Tbsp (23 g) roasted unsalted pistachios, minced
¼ cup (6 g) freeze-dried raspberries, minced
2 Tbsp (10 g) unsweetened toasted coconut flakes
2 Tbsp (25 g) candied pineapple pieces
1 Tbsp (1 g) dried red rose petals, crushed (optional)
2 tsp (7 g) hemp seeds
14 oz (400 g) dairy-free dark chocolate, broken into pieces
Directions
Prepare and have at-the-ready your desired toppings: the pistachios, dried raspberries, coconut flakes, hemp seeds, candied pineapple, and rose petals. Line a baking tray with parchment paper.
Fill a saucepan one-quarter full with water, and bring to a gentle boil. Place a large heat-safe bowl on top of the pan and add the chocolate. The heat from the bowl will melt the chocolate. Stir throughout.
Once melted, remove the bowl from the stove (be careful as the bowl will be hot). Pour the melted chocolate onto the baking tray.
Use the back of a rubber spatula to spread the chocolate out into a thin layer, about ½ cm thick.
Sprinkle over top all of the toppings. Then use the back of a spoon to gently press down the pieces into the chocolate. Place the chocolate bark in the fridge for at least 1 hour to harden.
Once solid, let slightly soften at room temperature for a minute before cutting to avoid it snapping in other places. Cut into your desired shapes and sizes. Enjoy!
Storage
Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.

Once the tofu is golden and crispy on all sides, transfer to a bowl and set aside.
Return the same pan to heat and add the oil. When hot, add the garlic and shallots and cook until lightly golden, about 3 minutes.
Add the curry paste, lemongrass, kaffir leaves, and ginger. Sauté for a minute.
Add the bell pepper, and cook for an extra 3 minutes.
Add the snow peas and cook for only 30 seconds, before transferring the green blended broth to the pan. Allow this to come to a gentle simmer, and then remove from the heat once heated through.
Remove the lemongrass and kaffir leaves before serving.
Finally, squeeze in the lime juice, stir, and then ladle the broth over top of the noodles.
Add the tofu to the top of the bowl, and add any desired garnishes. Enjoy!
Notes
* Refer to package instructions as you may need to cook your noodles differently.
Storage
If batch-making ahead of time, store the cooked noodles and broth separately and combine once heated, otherwise the noodles soak up too much of the broth and become too soft.
Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.

Creamy Butternut Squash & Sage Pasta
Servings: 4
Ingredients
Roasted squash & garlic
½ butternut squash
1 Tbsp (15 mL) olive oil
⅛ tsp salt
1 pinch ground black pepper
1 head garlic
Pasta
14 oz (400 g) dry rigatoni
1 Tbsp (15 mL) olive oil
½ cup (23 g) sage leaves, sliced
1 cup (240 mL) soy cooking cream
½ lemon, juiced
1 cup (20 g) arugula
Directions
Preheat oven to 390°F (200°C) and line a baking tray. Carefully peel the outer skin of the squash, or keep it on for extra fibre. Cut the butternut squash in half lengthwise. Use a spoon to scrape out the seeds and stringy bits and place these into a bowl of water.
Thinly slice the squash into ½ cm thick slices. Transfer to the baking tray, toss in oil, and sprinkle on some salt and pepper.
Cut the top ½ cm off a head of garlic to expose the cloves. Drizzle some oil on the garlic and place this on the baking tray as well. Bake the garlic and squash for 20 minutes.
Returning to the seeds in water, gently pick out the seeds and discard the stringy bits. Then drain and rinse the seeds until clean. Toss the seeds in a bit of oil, together with a sprinkle of salt and pepper to taste.
Remove the baking tray from the oven. Remove the head of garlic from the tray, and add in its place the squash seeds. Flip over the squash slices and return to the ovenfor another 10 - 15 minutes, or until the seeds are lightly golden, and the squash is thoroughly cooked.
Cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water. Cook until tender but not quite done - about 1 minute away from being al dente.
Meanwhile, heat a large pan on medium-high heat and add the oil and sage. Cook for 1 - 2 minutes, or until the sage shrivels. Add in the roasted garlic cloves, and mash with the back of a wooden spatula to purée it.
Scoop out ¾ cup (180 mL) of the pasta cooking water and add it to the pan. Then drain the pasta, and add this to the pan as well, along with the cooking cream. Cook for a minute until heated through.
Stir through the lemon juice, and plate while hot. Top with arugula, baked squash, and crispy squash seeds. Enjoy!
Storage
If not eating the entire dish right away, it's recommended to store the sauce and the pasta separately in airtight containers in the fridge for up to 3 days. Combine when ready to enjoy.

Sun-Dried Tomato & Roasted Vegetable Tart
Servings: 4
Ingredients
½ Tbsp (7 mL) olive oil, plus extra for brushing
2 medium onions, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1⅓ cups (179 g) frozen green peas
1 cup (150 g) sun-dried tomatoes in oil, drained
1 tsp (1 g) dried oregano
1 tsp (1 g) dried parsley
1 tsp (1 g) dried basil
½ tsp salt
¼ tsp ground black pepper
¾ cup (184 g) hummus†
3 Tbsp (20 g) breadcrumbs, divided
9.5 oz (270 g) vegan puff pastry dough
1 zucchini
2 carrots
Optional garnish
fresh parsley
Directions
Add the oil to a large pan over high heat. When hot, add the onions and garlic and cook for 2 - 3 minutes.
Then add the peas, sun-dried tomatoes, oregano, parsley, basil, salt, and pepper to the pan, and cook for another 2 - 3 minutes, or until most of the moisture has cooked off*.
Transfer the contents of the pan to a food processor, along with the hummus, and two-thirds of the breadcrumbs. Then blend this all up until smooth.
Grease a 9½ inch (25 cm) round tart pan, and lay the puff pastry dough in the pan. Gently press the pastry down and up along the sides, to about 3 cm in height.
Use a fork to poke holes in the bottom of the dough and sprinkle on the remaining breadcrumbs along the base.
Transfer the contents of the food processor to the tart pan, and use the back of a spoon to spread the mixture evenly across the base.
Preheat the oven to 390°F (200°C). Use a vegetable peeler to slice the zucchini and carrots into long, thin strips.
Gently press the veggie strips into the hummus mixture in a spiral pattern. When finished, roll in the overhanging dough around the perimeter to form a crust.
Brush a bit of olive oil on top of the vegetables and the dough around the rim. Bake on the middle rack of the preheated oven for 40 - 45 minutes, or until the crust is golden.
When removed from the oven, let the tart rest for at least 10 minutes, or until ready to serve. The longer you let the tart cool, the more firm it will become, which can make it easier to cut. Garnish before plating it up, and enjoy!
Notes
† If possible, try to use hummus for this recipe that's thicker. Some hummus varieties are more "runny" which can leave the centre of the tart quite soft, making it difficult to cut later.
* Less moisture at this stage means the final tart will be more firm in the centre, which makes it easier when cutting.
Storage
This tart is best enjoyed immediately.
The tart can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.
 
Caramelized Onions
Servings: 4
Ingredients
4 medium yellow onions
1 Tbsp (15 mL) vegetable oil
¼ tsp salt
1 Tbsp (15 mL) water (optional)
Directions
Slice the onion thinly and as uniformly as possible so that all of the onions cook evenly.
Add the oil to a heavy-bottomed pan on medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, drop the heat to medium* and add the onions. Add as many onions as fits in a single layer in the pan, but try not to overfill.
Stir the onion in the oil, and then let sit to cook for 50 - 60 minutes, stirring once every 10 minutes. Don't over-stir. About halfway through cooking, add the salt. This helps to draw any additional water out of the onions.
If the pan is looking very caramelized on the bottom, consider adding a splash of water, only if needed, to deglaze the pan.
When the onions are golden, remove them from the heat and enjoy!
Notes
* Ensure the heat of the pan is not too high. The longer the onions can caramelize at a lower temperature, the better.
Storage
Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days.

Ingredients
Herb & garlic oil
1½ Tbsp (22 mL) vegetable oil
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 tsp (1 g) dried parsley
¼ tsp salt
Naan
2 cups (276 g) all-purpose flour
½ cup (120 mL) unsweetened soy yogurt†
¼ cup (60 mL) unsweetened soy milk
½ Tbsp (7 g) granulated sugar
1 tsp (3 g) baking powder
¼ tsp salt
Directions
To a small bowl, add the oil, garlic, parsley, and salt. Whisk and set aside.

Vegan Caramel Sauce
Servings: 8
Ingredients
⅓ cup (75 g) unsalted margarine
⅓ cup (73 g) brown sugar, packed
⅓ cup (80 mL) coconut cream†
2 Tbsp (30 mL) maple syrup
¼ tsp salt
¼ tsp pure vanilla extract
Directions
To a saucepan, add all the ingredients except for the vanilla. Stir continuously while you bring it to a boil, then reduce to a simmer, cooking uncovered for 8 - 10 minutes to allow the sauce to thicken. Stir occasionally to prevent burning.
Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Allow the caramel sauce to sit and cool; it will continue to thicken as it cools, and thickens even more once refrigerated. Enjoy!
Notes
† Coconut cream is the thick part from the top of a can of coconut milk. It can help to separate this layer by refrigerating the can in the fridge overnight. We recommend using coconut milk that has no emulsifier (such as guar gum) in the ingredient list for a more desirable end-result consistency.
Storage
Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days.

Then add the wet ingredients and mix until just combined. Spoon the mixture evenly into the wells of the muffin tin. For decoration, add some chopped nuts and dried fruits on top. This is optional.
Bake on the middle rack of the oven for 20 - 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the centre comes out clean. Let cool, and enjoy!
Notes
† Use store-bought almond flour, or make it yourself by adding raw almonds to a food processor and blending until you achieve a flour-like consistency.
To gift these muffins in a jar, watch the accompanying video, or follow these instructions:
In order for the ingredients to fit, you'll need 1L mason jar. To create even and clean lines in your jar, lower your spoon low into the jar when adding each new layer. Then clean the inside of the glass with a small silicone pastry brush to clear it of any flour residue. Using the pastry brush, level out each layer before adding in the next layer.
Add the ingredients in the following order: flour (½ cup) > cacao powder > flour (½ cup) > brown sugar > flour (½ cup).
In a small bowl, mix together the sugar, flaxseeds, baking powder, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, salt, and cardamom. Then add this to the jar. Atop this layer, add the almond flour.
Use the back of a small ladle or measuring spoon to press down firmly and evenly on the contents within the jar. This should compress all the layers, creating more space at the top of the jar for the following ingredients.
Finally, add in the chopped walnuts, dried figs, and chocolate chips. Seal the jar with a lid, and decorate with string or flowers.
Print our ready-made printable PDF template to give with the jar, or write the following instructions on a card yourself:
To make the muffins: 1) Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). 2) Lightly grease a muffin tin. 3) Empty the jar into a large bowl, and stir to combine all the dry ingredients. 4) Add 1 cup (240 mL) plant-based milk, and ⅓ cup (80 mL) vegetable oil to the same bowl, and stir until just combined. For decoration, you could save some chopped nuts and fruits to put on top of the muffins before they go into the oven. 5) Divide the batter evenly into the wells of the muffin tin, and bake in the oven on the centre rack for 20 - 25 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out of the centre clean. Let cool, and enjoy!
Storage
The cooked muffins can be stored in an airtight container on the counter for up to 3 days.
The layered jar can be stored in a dark and cool place for up to 1 month.
 
Rocky Mountain Chocolate Bark
Servings: 15
Ingredients
¼ cup (56 g) granulated sugar
1½ Tbsp (22 mL) water
¼ cup (18 g) banana chips, chopped
¼ cup (34 g) roasted unsalted hazelnuts, chopped
2 gingerbread cookies, chopped
2 tsp (10 mL) peanut butter (optional)
¼ tsp flaked sea salt
14 oz (400 g) dairy-free dark chocolate
Directions
Line a baking tray with parchment paper. Add the sugar and water to a heavy-bottomed saucepan* on medium heat.
Avoid mixing with spoons or utensils as this can cause sugar crystals to form. If the mixture needs it, swirl the pan to help dissolve the sugar.
When the sugar is dissolved, turn the heat to medium-high and allow the mixture to bubble until it starts to turn golden, about 10 - 15 seconds.
Watch the sugar closely to avoid burning, as caramelization happens quickly. When caramelized to your liking, carefully** pour the liquid sugar onto the prepared baking tray.
Tilt the tray to spread the sugar out if desired for thinner shards.
Once completely cooled, use the back of a spoon to tap the caramel and break it into shards. Place these in a bowl and set aside. Keep the paper on the baking tray as it will be used again.
Prepare and have at-the-ready your desired toppings: banana chips, hazelnuts, cookies, peanut butter, and salt.
Melt the chocolate in a microwave or on the stove, using a double boiler.
Once melted, remove the bowl from the microwave or the stove, and be careful as the bowl will be hot. Gently pour the melted chocolate onto the same parchment-lined baking tray used before. Use the back of a rubber spatula to spread the chocolate out into a thin layer, about ½ cm thick.
The chocolate can now be decorated! Drizzle the peanut butter over the chocolate, and then sprinkle over top the banana chips, hazelnuts, cookie crumbles, salt, and caramel shards. Using the back of a spoon, gently press the pieces into the chocolate to secure them.
Let harden at room temperature, or place in the fridge to harden. Once hard, let slightly soften at room temperature before cutting. Cut into desired shapes and sizes. Enjoy!
Notes
* A heavy-bottomed pan is thicker at the base, meaning it can distribute heat better than a thinner pan. As a result, the sugar will melt more evenly and is less likely to burn.
** Be extremely careful with this, as the melted sugar is incredibly hot.
Storage
The chocolate bark can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.
 
Cinnamon Vanilla Nut Butter
Servings: 21
Ingredients
1½ cups (148 g) raw pecans
1½ cups (195 g) raw cashews

½ tsp pure vanilla extract
¼ tsp salt
Directions
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Spread the cashews on one baking tray, and the pecans on another. Toast for 7 minutes. Remove the pecan tray from the oven and set it aside to cool.
Stir the cashews and return them to the oven to toast for an extra 5 minutes, or until lightly golden. Careful not to burn. When toasted, remove from the oven.
To a food processor (ideally 600W or higher), add the toasted nuts, cinnamon, vanilla, and salt. Blend on high for 5 - 7 minutes until a smooth*.
Transfer to a jar for storage. Enjoy!
Notes
* If your food processor isn't very powerful, blend for up to an extra 5 minutes or consider adding a bit of vegetable or coconut oil.
Storage

Almond Brownie Cookies
Servings: 12
Ingredients
2 Tbsp (14 g) ground flaxseeds
¼ cup (60 mL) water
5.3 oz (150 g) dairy-free dark chocolate, broken into pieces†
3 Tbsp (41 g) refined coconut oil‡
½ cup (90 g) brown sugar, lightly packed, lightly packed
⅓ cup (46 g) roasted unsalted almonds, coarsely chopped
1 tsp (5 mL) pure vanilla extract
1 cup (138 g) all-purpose flour††
½ tsp baking powder
½ tsp salt
Optional garnish
flaked sea salt
Directions
In a small bowl, mix together the flaxseeds and water. Set aside.
Fill a saucepan halfway with water and bring to a boil. Place a large heat-safe bowl on top of the saucepan. Add the chocolate and coconut oil, mixing until it's all melted.
Then add the brown sugar and mix well. Remove the bowl from the saucepan. Be careful as the bowl will be hot.
To the same bowl, add the flaxseed mixture, almonds, and vanilla. Stir to combine.
Place a sieve over the bowl, and sift in the flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir until just combined, careful not to over-mix. Let the dough rest at room temperature for 15 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C) and line a baking tray with parchment paper.
Scoop up about 1½ Tbsp fo the dough and roll into little balls with your hands. The cookies don't spread much on their own, so place them on the baking tray and gently press the dough down to create little disks about 1 cm thick. Leave about 5 cm between each cookie on the tray.
To decorate, gently press a couple of small pieces of chopped chocolate and chopped almonds to the top of each cookie before baking in the oven for 10 - 11 minutes.
When the cookies are removed from the oven, sprinkle with some sea salt, if desired. Let cool on the baking tray for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy!
Notes
† Tip: best to choose a chocolate that's tasty enough that you'd enjoy eating it on its own. Chocolate is one of the main ingredients in this recipe, so the taste of the final cookies depends largely on the taste of the chocolate used.
‡ Refined coconut oil is coconut oil that doesn't smell or taste like coconuts. If you prefer a distinct coconut taste, use unrefined coconut oil instead.
†† We've also made this recipe using 1¼ cup (156 g) flour, which yields a more firm, cake-like cookie rather than a soft and brownie-like cookie. Both taste delicious, so you can use whichever measurement you prefer.
Storage
Store in an airtight container on the counter for up to 3 days.
 
Vegan Gingerbread Latte
Servings: 2
Ingredients
3 cups (720 mL) barista oat milk
½ cup (120 mL) brewed espresso
2 Tbsp (30 mL) maple syrup
½ Tbsp (7 mL) blackstrap molasses†
1 tsp (3 g) ground cinnamon
½ tsp ground ginger
1 pinch ground nutmeg
1 pinch ground cloves
Optional garnish
coconut whip
crushed gingerbread cookies
vegan whipped cream
Directions
Add the barista milk to a saucepan on high heat. Whisk throughout to create some froth. Stay with it, as it often only needs a minute to heat through. When the milk starts to simmer, remove the pan from the heat and pour it into your desired mugs.
Return the saucepan to the stove on medium heat, and whisk together the espresso, maple syrup, molasses, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and clove. Let everything heat through.
Divide the espresso mixture between your mugs and top with whipped cream and cookie crumbles, if desired. Serve while hot, and enjoy!
Notes
† Blackstrap molasses is a dark, thick, often bitter syrup, which is produced during the sugar-making process. You can substitute it with 1 Tbsp (15 mL) dark corn syrup, or maple syrup, or ¾ Tbsp (9 g) packed brown sugar or granulated sugar.
Storage
Best if enjoyed immediately.

1⅓ cups (100 g) unsweetened shredded coconut
1 cup (99 g) raw pecans, chopped
¾ cup (126 g) dairy-free dark chocolate chips
Optional garnish
coarse sea salt
Directions
Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C) and line a baking tray with parchment paper.
Add the margarine, brown sugar, and granulated sugar to a large bowl. Whip with an electric hand mixer or cream using a fork.
Add the applesauce, flaxseeds, cinnamon, vanilla, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whip again, until everything is well combined.
Add the flour, oats, and shredded coconut. Gently fold these into the dough with a spoon until partially combined.
Fold in the pecans and chocolate chips. Stir again until just combined, but try not to over-mix.
Scoop up a ¼ cup of the dough and roll it into a ball. Then flatten to create a cookie that's about 1½ cm thick*.
Place the cookies on the prepared baking tray, leaving about 3 cm space between each cookie. If desired, press some chocolate chips or chopped pecans onto the top of each cookie before baking.
Bake in the centre rack of the oven for 12 - 14 minutes, or until lightly golden. Let the cookies rest for a few minutes on the baking tray before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy!
Notes
* These cookies don't spread when cooking, so they need to be press down into the desired shape.
Storage
Store the cookies in an airtight container on the counter for up to 3 days.
The cookies can also be stored in the freezer for up to 2 months.
 
Cinnamon Coconut Cream Latte
Servings: 2
Ingredients
½ cup (120 mL) canned full-fat coconut milk†
¼ cup (48 g) coconut sugar
½ tsp ground cinnamon
1½ cups (360 mL) barista oat milk‡
⅛ tsp pure vanilla extract (optional)
½ cup (120 mL) brewed espresso
Optional garnish
foamed milk
ground cinnamon
Directions
To a saucepan, add coconut milk, coconut sugar, and cinnamon. Cook at a simmer for 5 minutes, stirring often to prevent burning.
When the mixture has thickened and resembles a caramel sauce, add the milk and vanilla. Whisk to combine. Bring to a boil, then remove from the heat.
Brew the espresso into your desired cups.
Pour the warm cinnamon coconut milk mixture overtop your espresso. Top with foamed milk and a sprinkle of cinnamon if desired. Enjoy!
Notes
† We recommend using a coconut milk can that has no emulsifier (such as guar gum) in the ingredient list. We've found this results in a more desirable consistency.
‡ Barista milk often has a higher proportion of fat and carbohydrates than other plant-based milk, which gives it a nice creamy texture.
Storage
Best if enjoyed immediately.
 
Vegan "Egg" Salad Breakfast Bowl
Servings: 4
Ingredients
Roasted vegetables
4 medium potatoes, cut into 1 cm cubes
1 Tbsp (15 mL) vegetable oil
1 tsp (2 g) onion powder
½ tsp paprika powder
½ tsp dried rosemary
¼ tsp salt
¼ tsp ground black pepper
20 cherry tomatoes, on the vine
Vegan "egg" salad
1 tsp (5 mL) vegetable oil
23 oz (650 g) firm tofu, pressed
½ tsp salt
¼ tsp ground turmeric
¼ tsp ground black pepper
½ cup (120 mL) vegan mayonnaise
1 tsp (2 g) curry powder
1 stalk green onion
Garlic spinach
2 tsp (10 mL) vegetable oil
8 cloves garlic, minced
10 cups (300 g) fresh spinach
1 Tbsp (15 mL) sodium-reduced soy sauce
1 tsp (5 mL) sambal oelek
Serve with
1 avocado, quartered
Directions
Preheat the oven to 390°F (200°C). Add the potatoes to a baking tray and drizzle over the oil. Toss to coat.
Then sprinkle over the onion powder, paprika, rosemary, salt, and pepper, and toss again.
Bake for 20 minutes, then stop to stir. At this point, also add the vine of tomatoes to the tray to bake with the potatoes. Return to the oven for another 20 - 25 minutes, or until golden.
Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large pan on medium-high. Crumble in the tofu with your hands. Cook for 5 - 7 minutes, stirring throughout. The aim is to get the tofu soft and spongy, but not too crispy.
Then add in the salt, turmeric, and pepper, and cook for an additional 1 - 2 minutes while stirring, so that the spices toast.
Remove from the heat, and transfer the tofu to a bowl. Add in the mayo and curry powder, and stir well.
Thinly slice the entire stalk of green onion. The white bottom part of the onion can be further minced and then stirred into the "egg" salad mixture. The sliced green part of the onion can be reserved for garnish.
For the garlic spinach, heat the oil in a large pan on medium-high. When hot, add the garlic and cook until golden, about 4 - 5 minutes.
Then add all the spinach, soy sauce, and sambal. Cook for another minute, or until the spinach is wilted.
Serve each component of the meal in bowls, alongside some avocado. Enjoy!
Storage
Best if enjoyed immediately.
The potatoes, egg salad, and garlic spinach can be stored separately in airtight containers in the fridge for up to 3 days.
 
Spicy Garlic Tofu
Servings: 4
Ingredients
Tofu
16 oz (450 g) firm tofu, pressed
2 Tbsp (16 g) cornstarch
1 Tbsp (15 mL) vegetable oil
½ tsp salt
¼ tsp ground black pepper
Sauce
2 Tbsp (30 mL) maple syrup
1 Tbsp (15 mL) gochujang chili paste†
1 Tbsp (15 mL) sodium-reduced soy sauce
1 Tbsp (15 mL) rice vinegar
Sautéed aromatics
2 Tbsp (30 mL) vegetable oil
5 cloves garlic, minced
1 medium shallot, diced
2 red hot chili peppers, thinly sliced
2 stalks green onion, thinly sliced
Directions
Ensure the tofu is sufficiently pressed before cutting it into 1 cm cubes*.
To a large bowl, add the tofu cubes, cornstarch, oil, salt, and pepper. Gently toss to coat.
Heat up a large pan over high heat and add the tofu, cooking for about 10 minutes, or until crispy. Try to not disturb the tofu too much, otherwise, it crumbles. Give it a toss only every couple of minutes, so that it cooks evenly on all sides.
Meanwhile, make the sauce by mixing the maple syrup, gochujang, soy sauce, and vinegar in a small bowl. Set aside.
When the tofu is crisped to your liking, transfer it to a plate. Return the same pan to the heat, and add the vegetable oil. When hot, add the garlic, shallot, chilis, and green onion all at once. Sauté for 4 - 5 minutes.
Reduce the heat to medium-high and add the sauce, cooking for another 4 - 5 minutes or until the sauce becomes sticky.
Add the tofu to the pan, and stir to coat. Garnish, serve, and enjoy!
Notes
† Gochujang is a Korean fermented red chili paste, which has a sweet, savoury, and spicy flavour profile. It can be found in most Asian supermarkets, but you could also substitute it with another hot sauce, such as Sriracha, if desired.
* The more liquid that can be drained, the quicker the tofu cooks and the crispier it gets.
Storage
The tofu can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.
 
Buffalo Style Tofu Strips
Servings: 22
Ingredients
Tofu base
16 oz (450 g) firm tofu, pressed
¼ cup (32 g) cornstarch
½ cup (120 mL) unsweetened soy milk
½ cup (54 g) breadcrumbs
1 tsp (2 g) paprika powder
½ tsp ground cumin
½ tsp garlic powder
¼ tsp ground black pepper
Buffalo sauce
½ cup (120 mL) cayenne pepper hot sauce
¼ cup (56 g) unsalted vegan butter
½ tsp onion powder
Vegan ranch dip
½ cup (120 mL) vegan mayonnaise
2 Tbsp (30 mL) unsweetened soy milk
¼ lemon , juiced
1 tsp (1 g) nutritional yeast flakes
1 tsp (1 g) dried parsley
¼ tsp dried chives
¼ tsp garlic powder
¼ tsp onion powder
⅛ tsp dried dill
⅛ tsp salt
1 pinch ground black pepper
Directions
Preheat the oven to 430°F (220°C) and line a baking tray with parchment paper. Cut the pressed tofu into sticks about 3 inches long x ½ inch thick (8 cm x 1 cm).
Prepare 3 large shallow bowls: the first one with cornstarch; the second with milk; and the third with the mixture of bread crumbs, paprika powder, cumin, garlic powder, and pepper.
Dip the tofu sticks in the cornstarch first to evenly coat in a thin layer. Brush off any excess clumps of cornstarch.
Then dunk the strips into the milk, letting any excess liquid drip off, before transferring the strips to the breadcrumb mixture. Roll to evenly coat.
Transfer the coated strips to the baking tray. Bake on the centre rack of the oven for 25 - 30 minutes, or until the sticks are golden, flipping once halfway.
Meanwhile, make the vegan ranch dip by mixing all the ingredients in a jar.
Next, make the buffalo sauce. To a saucepan on medium-high heat, add the hot sauce, butter, and onion powder. Stir and cook until the butter has melted, then remove from the heat.
When the tofu sticks are finished baking, remove them from the oven. When they are still warm but cool enough to handle, dip them into the buffalo sauce. Let any excess sauce drip off before transferring the sticks to a serving plate.
Serve the buffalo tofu sticks with the vegan ranch, or serve in tortillas with your favourite fillings. Enjoy!
Storage
Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 days.
 
Oven Roasted Sweet Potato & Tofu Veggie Skewers
Servings: 21
Ingredients
Tofu
16 oz (450 g) firm tofu, pressed
1 tsp (5 mL) olive oil
1 Tbsp (8 g) cornstarch (optional)
1 tsp (3 g) garlic powder
½ tsp salt
¼ tsp ground black pepper
Marinade
2 Tbsp (30 mL) olive oil
½ lemon, juiced
¼ tsp dried oregano
¼ tsp dried thyme
¼ tsp dried basil
¼ tsp salt
⅛ tsp ground black pepper
Skewers
1 yellow bell pepper, chopped in 1-inch pieces
1 red bell pepper, chopped in 1-inch pieces
1 large red onion, , chopped in 1-inch pieces
1 large sweet potato, cut into very thin bite-sized squares†
½ zucchini, cut into thin bite-sized squares
21 cherry tomatoes
Serves well with
vegan tzatziki
Directions
Soak about 20 - 25 wooden 7 inch (18 cm) skewers in a shallow dish of water for about 15 minutes. This will prevent the skewers from burning when they are baking. Preheat the oven to 390°F (200°C).
Cut the tofu into 1 inch (2 cm) bite-sized squares that are rather thin, but not too thin that they fall apart when threading through the skewer. If cut too thick, they won't crisp up as nicely.
To a large shallow dish, add the tofu pieces, drizzle over the olive oil, and gently toss to coat. Then add the cornstarch, garlic powder, salt, and pepper, and give it another gentle toss.
To a medium bowl, add the ingredients for the marinade, and give it a mix.
Thread the tofu on the skewers along with the chopped veggies. Repeat until the skewer is filled up, and finish it with a cherry tomato on top.
Brush the marinade over the skewers, and place the skewers onto a wire rack. Place the rack into the centre of the oven, with a baking tray underneath to catch any liquid that drips off.
Bake in the oven for 25 - 30 minutes, or until the veggies are cooked to your liking. These skewers are delicious on their own, but we definitely recommend enjoying them together with our vegan tzatziki recipe! Enjoy!
Notes
† The sweet potato needs to be cut thinly so that it finishes cooking at the same time as the other veggies.
Storage
The skewers can be stored in airtight containers in the fridge for up to 3 days.

Homemade Vegan Kimchi
Servings: 16
Ingredients
1 fresh napa cabbage, cut into 2 cm pieces
¼ cup (72 g) coarse sea salt (must be iodine free)†
½ cup (120 mL) cold water
6 cloves garlic
¼ cup (32 g) gochugaru (Korean red chili pepper)‡
2 Tbsp (30 mL) sodium-reduced soy sauce
3 medium shallots
½ Tbsp (3 g) freshly grated ginger
2 tsp (9 g) granulated sugar
4 stalks green onion, sliced lengthwise, cut into 2 cm strips
Directions
To a large bowl, add the cabbage and sea salt. Massage the salted cabbage for a few minutes. The salt helps to draw water out of the cabbage and softens it.
Pour the water overtop the cabbage and let the cabbage rest on the counter for at least 2 hours, or up to 6 hours.
In the meantime, to a food processor, add the garlic, gochugaru, soy sauce, shallot, ginger, and sugar. Blend until a smooth consistency is reached.
After the cabbage has rested, run it under cold water to wash the salt off, and then squeeze out any excess water with your hands. Transfer the drained cabbage back to the large bowl.
Add the blended chili mixture to the cabbage, along with the green onions, and give it a mix until everything is evenly coated.
To a mason jar, add the cabbage and press it down firmly with a spoon, fully submerging the cabbage below a layer of brine*. Leave an inch (2cm) of "breathing room" at the top of each jar for the gas that's produced during fermentation.
Close tightly with a lid. Leave the kimchi on the counter overnight, away from direct sunlight or any heat sources.
The next day, open the lid to allow some trapped gas to escape. Taste test; the kimchi should taste mildly sour, and some bubbles should be visible in the jar. If you prefer more tangy kimchi, leave it to sit on the counter for an additional 1 - 2 days**. Open the container to 'burp' twice a day in this case.
Then close the lid of the jar, and place the kimchi in the fridge for 1 - 2 weeks to continue to ferment and set. Every 3 - 4 days, open the lid to allow the trapped gasses to escape and push down the mixture to submerge it under the liquid when necessary. The longer it sits, the more complex and delicious the flavours. Enjoy!
Notes
† The salt must be iodine-free, otherwise the salt may inhibit the fermentation process.
‡ Gochugaru is made from Korean dried red chili peppers, also known as taeyang-cho. To get the authentic flavour, red chili flakes are not advised for this recipe.
* Any bits that poke up above the brine may lead to the development of mould.
** Personally, I let it ferment for one day in the warmer summer months when fermentation takes place more quickly, and 2 days in the winter months when fermentation is slower.
Storage
The kimchi can be stored in a mason jar or airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 months. Make sure to use clean utensils each time you remove some of the kimchi from the jar, to keep it lasting longer.

Chickpea Omelette Sandwich
Servings: 3
Ingredients
Omelettes
1 Tbsp (7 g) ground flaxseeds
3 Tbsp (45 mL) water
½ cup (58 g) chickpea flour
½ cup (120 mL) unsweetened soy milk
1 Tbsp (2 g) nutritional yeast flakes
¼ tsp onion powder
¼ tsp garlic powder
¼ tsp kala namak (optional)†
¼ tsp salt
⅛ tsp ground black pepper
½ red bell pepper, minced, divided
1 small red onion, minced, divided
1 Tbsp (15 mL) olive oil, for frying
Sandwich toppings
6 slices whole wheat bread
2 tsp (10 mL) olive oil
3 Tbsp (45 mL) vegan mayonnaise
1 cup (35 g) romaine lettuce
1 medium tomato, thinly sliced
1 avocado, thinly sliced
Optional garnish
fresh parsley
sriracha hot sauce
Directions
In a large bowl, mix together the ground flaxseeds and water. Set aside for 5 minutes to gel.
Then add the chickpea flour, milk, nutritional yeast, onion powder, garlic powder, kala namak, salt, pepper, and half of the chopped bell pepper and red onions. Mix until well combined.
Heat a large pan or skillet over medium-high heat and add some of the olive oil. Working in batches, add about two tablespoons of the omelette mixture to create a thin little omelette.
When golden on the bottom, flip the omelettes over and cook on the other side. Repeat this process until you've finished the batter.
Toast the bread by brushing some olive oil on both sides of the slices. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat, and toast the bread for 2 minutes on each side, until crispy and golden.
Assemble the sandwich by spreading some mayonnaise on each slice. Top with lettuce, the omelette, tomato slices, avocado, the remaining raw bell pepper and onions. Enjoy!
Notes
† Kala namak, also known as Himalayan black salt, is a salt often used in South Asian cuisine. The sulphur compounds give the salt an egg-like smell and flavour, which makes it perfect to use in an omelette like this one.
Storage
The omelette can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.
 
Vegan Breakfast Waffles
Servings: 7
Ingredients
1½ cups (360 mL) unsweetened soy milk†
1 Tbsp (15 mL) apple cider vinegar
2 cups (252 g) whole wheat flour
⅓ cup (80 mL) unsweetened applesauce
2 tsp (7 g) baking powder
1 tsp (3 g) ground cinnamon
1 tsp (5 mL) pure vanilla extract
½ tsp salt
Optional toppings
any nut butter of choice
fresh mixed berries
maple syrup
powdered sugar
unsweetened coconut yogurt
Directions
To a large bowl, add the milk and vinegar, mix, and let this rest for 5 minutes. The milk will start to slightly curdle, and this is normal.
Heat the waffle maker. Then, returning to the bowl, add the flour, applesauce, baking powder, cinnamon, vanilla, and salt, then mix until just combined.
Brush the waffle pan with some oil. Add a few spoonfuls of the waffle batter until the element is filled near to the top. Gently close the lid, and let it cook for 4 - 5 minutes, or until golden. Repeat this with the remaining batter.
Add desired toppings to your waffles, and enjoy!
Notes
† We recommend using either soy or pea milk for this recipe, as the high protein content of these milks are what allows the milk to curdle to create vegan buttermilk. We can't guarantee other plant-based milk will be successful.
Storage
Best if enjoyed immediately.
The waffles can be stored separately from the toppings in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 days.
Batch make and store these waffles in the freezer for up to 2 months. Simply pop in the toaster or oven to reheat and serve for a speedy breakfast.
 
BBQ Cauliflower Pizza
Servings: 4
Ingredients
Pizza dough
2½ cups + 2 Tbsp (328 g) self-rising flour†
1 cup (240 mL) water
2 Tbsp (30 mL) olive oil
1 tsp (6 g) salt
BBQ cauliflower
½ head cauliflower, broken into florets
¾ cup (180 mL) barbecue sauce (or less for a milder BBQ taste)
½ tsp garlic powder
½ tsp onion powder
Pizza sauce
¾ cup (184 g) hummus‡
⅓ cup (87 g) tomato paste
1 tsp (1 g) dried oregano
1 tsp (1 g) dried basil
½ tsp dried thyme
½ tsp salt
¼ tsp ground black pepper
Garlic yogurt sauce
¾ cup (180 mL) unsweetened soy yogurt††
2 cloves garlic, crushed
¼ tsp salt
Optional garnish
sliced green onion
Directions
Combine all of the pizza dough ingredients in a large bowl and mix until well combined.
Transfer to a floured surface and knead until you have a smooth, firm dough. Add a sprinkle of flour if too wet, or a small splash of water if too dry.
Cover the dough with a clean kitchen towel and let it rest for about 20 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 430°F (220°C). Add the cauliflower florets to a lined baking tray.
To a small bowl, mix together the BBQ sauce, garlic powder, and onion powder. Pour half of the sauce over the florets, and toss to coat. Reserve the other half of the BBQ sauce for later.
Bake the BBQ cauliflower florets for 20 minutes, flipping once halfway.
In a medium bowl, mix together the hummus, tomato paste, oregano, basil, thyme, salt, and pepper.
Lightly coat a work surface with flour. Divide the dough into two balls, as this recipe makes two large pizza crusts.
Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough to the size of your baking tray - ours was 25 x 35 cm*.
Divide the hummus-based pizza sauce over both pizza bases, and spread it out evenly. Leave about 1 cm around the edges of the pizza uncovered for the crust.
When the cauliflower is removed from the oven, pour over the remaining BBQ sauce. Toss to coat.
Divide and distribute the BBQ cauliflower florets over top of both pizzas.
Bake the pizzas in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until the crust is lightly golden. Rotate the position of the pizzas in the oven once at the halfway point.
Meanwhile, combine the yogurt, garlic, and salt in a bowl.
When the pizzas are ready, drizzle some of the garlic yogurt sauce on top, and sprinkle with sliced green onion, if desired. Enjoy!
Notes
† Self-rising flour is regular all-purpose flour, but with baking powder, and sometimes salt added to it. Self-rising flour can be found at most grocery stores located near the regular flour.
‡ We used spicy hummus, but you could try other flavours that are available to you.
†† Nutrition tip: aim to use a plant-based yogurt that is fortified with calcium.
* If the rolled pizza dough isn't cooperating - either because it's not moulding into the shape you want, or if it rips - simply knead it a few more times until smooth, and try again. Keep your surface and rolling pin well-floured, so it doesn't stick.
Storage
Best to enjoy immediately.
The pizza can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.
 
Creamy Green Leek & Pea Pasta
Servings: 4
Ingredients
1 leek
4 cloves garlic
2 stalks green onion
1 jalapeño, seeds removed
1 large broccoli
1 Tbsp (15 mL) olive oil
1 tsp (6 g) salt
1½ cups (201 g) frozen green peas
⅔ cup (127 g) frozen spinach
½ tsp dried basil
¼ tsp dried oregano
¼ tsp dried mint leaves (optional)
4 cups (300 g) dry fusilli pasta
1 cup (240 mL) soy cooking cream
½ lemon, juiced
Optional garnish
fresh basil
lemon slice
Directions
Prepare the leek by cutting off the root and the overly fibrous green parts. Cut the leek in half, wash in between the layers thoroughly, and then thinly slice the leek. Thinly slice the garlic and green onions, and mince the jalapeño.
Cut the stem off the head of broccoli. Cutaway the fibrous outer layer. Chop the remaining stem and green tops of the broccoli into small bite-sized pieces, but keep them separated.
To a large pot on high heat, add the oil. When hot, add in the leek, broccoli stems, garlic, green onion, jalapeño, and salt. Cook for 5 minutes.
Then add the peas, spinach, basil, oregano, and mint, cooking for another 5 - 6 minutes.
Meanwhile, cook the pasta according to the package instructions, adding the broccoli florets in the last couple of minutes.
Just before draining the noodles and broccoli, scoop out ½ cup (120 mL) cooking water from pasta and add to the pan with the vegetables.
Add the cooking cream to the pan with the vegetables, and stir to combine.
You can leave this pasta sauce chunky, or make it smooth by blending it using an immersion blender or standing blender. We chose to blend about half of our sauce, making it part-chunky and part-smooth.
Add the drained pasta and broccoli to the sauce, and toss to coat.
Add the lemon juice, and serve while hot. Garnish as desired. Enjoy!
Storage
Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.
 
Vegan Paella: Spanish-Inspired Rice
Servings: 4
Ingredients
1 Tbsp (15 mL) olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tsp (6 g) salt
½ tsp ground black pepper
1 tsp (2 g) smoked sweet paprika powder
1 tsp (1 g) dried thyme
½ tsp ground cumin
½ tsp dried oregano
½ tsp cayenne pepper
2 medium tomatoes, diced
1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
1½ cups (300 g) uncooked Spanish paella rice
4 cups (960 mL) boiling water
2 vegetable bouillon cubes
1 pinch saffron threads (optional, but recommended)
1 cup (134 g) frozen green peas
1½ cups (255 g) canned artichoke hearts, chopped
Optional garnish
lemon slice
Directions
Add the oil to a large pan* or paella pan over medium-high heat. When hot, add the onion, garlic, salt, and pepper. Cook this for 3 minutes.
Then add the paprika, thyme, cumin, oregano, and cayenne. Cook while stirring for 30 - 60 seconds to toast the spices.
Add in the tomatoes and bell pepper (reserving a few slices for garnish, if desired). Cook for 2 - 3 minutes.
Then, add the paella rice, toasting this for 1 - 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.
In a large jug, mix the boiling water and bouillon so that the cubes dissolve**.
Add the liquid and saffron to the pan, and bring to a rapid simmer for 2 minutes. Then reduce to a gentle simmer and cook uncovered for 20 - 30 minutes, or until the rice is tender. Avoid stirring the rice while it cooks.
When the liquid has been absorbed by the rice, taste-test. Try the rice on the outer-most part of the pan, as that's the rice that will cook last given it's furthest away from the heat source. If the rice is firm but tender, it's ready. Otherwise, add a splash of boiling water or hot stock, and let it continue to cook until the rice is cooked through.
When the rice is cooked, add the peas and half of the artichokes. Gently stir it in, then add the remaining artichokes on top, along with the reserved bell pepper slices.
Remove the pan from the heat, cover with a lid, and let the paella rest for 10 minutes. Do not skip this step, as it makes all the difference in the taste and texture of the rice.
Remove the lid, garnish, and enjoy!
Notes
* Try to use a pan that has a large cooking surface on the bottom, so that the rice cooks evenly throughout. A wok-shaped pan, for example, may result in cooked rice in the centre of the pan, but uncooked rice around the perimeter of the pan.
** The water and bouillon cubes can be swapped for vegetable stock if desired. Simply add more salt to taste.
Storage
The paella can be stored an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days.

2 roasted red bell peppers from a jar
3 Tbsp (45 mL) black bean garlic sauce, divided
Sauce
3 Tbsp (45 mL) rice vinegar
1 Tbsp (15 mL) sodium-reduced soy sauce
½ Tbsp (7 mL) sesame oil
Optional garnish
red hot chili pepper
sliced green onion
toasted sesame seeds
Directions
Cook soba noodles according to package directions. Once cooked, drain and rinse under cold water to stop the cooking process. Toss with the sesame oil to prevent the noodles from sticking together. Set aside.
Add the edamame beans to a bowl and cover them with boiling water. Let it sit while the other ingredients are being prepared.
Cut the tofu into ½ inch (1 cm) cubes. Transfer to a bowl, and toss with the cornstarch, salt, and pepper.
Preheat a large pan on high heat with the vegetable oil. When hot, place the tofu in a single layer on the heated pan and fry until all sides are golden, about 10 - 15 minutes. Try to not disturb the tofu too much as it cooks to prevent it from crumbling.
Thinly slice the bok choy leaves and stems into bite-sized pieces. Keep the green leaves and white stems separated for now. Trim the green beans and cut into thirds. Thinly slice the bell pepper.
Once the tofu is completely cooked, add about one third of the black bean garlic sauce and toss to coat. Transfer to a bowl.
Return the pan to the high heat and add the white bok choy stems and green beans, along with a very small splash (5 - 10 mL) of water. Cook until softened, but still crunchy, about 3 minutes.
Add the bok choy leaves and the remaining black bean sauce, and sauté until the bok choy leaves are wilted. Transfer to a bowl.
Drain the edamame.
In a jar, combine the rice vinegar, soy sauce, and sesame oil.
To assemble, place some of the cooled* soba noodles in a bowl and top with the tofu, green bean and bok choy vegetables, some drained edamame, and some sliced roasted red pepper. Drizzle the sauce over the bowl and garnish if desired. Enjoy!

Baked Green Pea & Chickpea Falafels
Servings: 6
Ingredients
Falafels
2 cups (328 g) cooked chickpeas
1 cup (134 g) frozen green peas
2 cloves garlic
1 lemon, juiced
1 stalk green onion
¼ cup (4 g) fresh parsley
¼ cup (8 g) fresh mint leaves (optional)
2 Tbsp (30 mL) tahini
2 Tbsp (17 g) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
2 Tbsp (14 g) ground flaxseeds
2 tsp (4 g) ground cumin
2 tsp (3 g) whole coriander seeds
¼ tsp cayenne pepper
1 Tbsp (15 mL) olive oil
Assembly
6 whole wheat pita breads
1 cup (189 g) vegan tzatziki
1 cup (246 g) hummus
1 cup (35 g) romaine lettuce, chopped
¾ cup (112 g) cherry tomatoes, chopped
Directions
Preheat the oven to 390°F (200°C) and line a baking tray.
Drain and rinse the chickpeas if from a jar or can, and dry well using a kitchen cloth.
Rinse the frozen peas with warm water until defrosted. Then using your hands, squeeze as much liquid out of the peas as possible.
Add all the ingredients except for the olive oil to a food processor and blend until smooth. Let the mixture sit for 5 to firm up.
Scoop up 1 Tbsp of the mixture at a time and shape into small patties. Coat your hands with a bit of flour to keep the mixture from sticking*.
Dust both sides of the formed patties with flour, and then brush a generous amount of oil on both sides as well.
Place on the prepared baking tray, then bake on the centre rack of the preheated oven until golden, about 30 minutes, giving the patties a flip once halfway.
Enjoy the patties in a wrap, nourish bowl, or salad.
Notes
* A slightly moist mixture makes for better falafels as baking them dries them out. If the mixture is too wet, add 1 Tbsp more of either flour, ground flaxseeds, or breadcrumbs, and let it sit again for a few minutes to absorb the liquid.
Storage
Store baked patties in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days.

Tea-Infused Chocolate Mousse
Servings: 6
Ingredients
1 cup (240 mL) aquafaba†
2 bags flavoured tea (optional) ‡
6.2 oz (175 g) dairy-free dark chocolate
Optional garnish
lemon zest
pomegranate seeds
Directions
Add the aquafaba and tea bags* to a saucepan over medium-high heat. Remove the pan from the heat just before it starts to simmer.
Make sure your bowl and electric hand mixer are grease-free. Transfer the liquid and tea bags to a large bowl to cool. When cooled, remove the tea bags.
Melt the chocolate using a microwave or on the stove, using a double boiler. Let the chocolate cool off a bit.
Beat the cooled aquafaba until stiff peaks are formed, this should take around 6 - 8 minutes.
In a slow and steady stream, add the melted chocolate to the aquafaba, carefully folding with a rubber spatula. Be careful not to over-mix, as the mousse can lose its air.
Scoop the mixture into some glass jars and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or overnight. When ready to serve, top with your desired garnish, and enjoy!
Notes
† The liquid from a jar or can of chickpeas, or the liquid that chickpeas were cooked in.
‡ We really enjoyed using lemon-infused green tea for this recipe, but use whatever flavour you like. You can also omit the tea-infusion entirely.
* Skip warming up the aquafaba if omitting the tea.
Storage

Servings: 4
Ingredients
Roasted eggplant
2 medium eggplants
1 tsp (5 mL) olive oil
1 tsp (6 g) salt
Curry
1 cup (200 g) uncooked basmati rice
2 tsp (10 mL) vegetable oil
1 medium onion, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 tsp (4 g) ground cumin
2 tsp (4 g) ground coriander
1 tsp (3 g) ground cinnamon
1 bell pepper, diced
1⅔ cups (400 g) canned diced tomatoes
1 cup (198 g) cooked brown lentils
¼ cup (32 g) dried apricots, diced
½ tsp salt
¼ tsp ground black pepper
Toppings
¾ cup (180 mL) unsweetened coconut yogurt
5 fresh mint leaves, thinly sliced
½ lemon, cut into wedges
Directions
Preheat oven to 390°F (200°C). Cut each eggplant in half lengthwise and cut cross-hatches into the flesh*.
Sprinkle each side with oil and salt and rub them in. Place the eggplant on a lined baking tray cut side down, and bake for 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, cook the rice according to the package instructions.
Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large pot on medium-high heat. Sauté the onions until soft, about 3 - 5 minutes. Add splashes of water as needed to deglaze the pot.
Add the garlic, cumin, coriander, and cinnamon and sauté until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Then remove the pot from the heat.
Remove the roasted eggplant from the oven. When cool enough to handle, use a spoon to scrape out the softened eggplant, discarding the skin.
Return the pot to the heat. Add the bell pepper, tomatoes, lentils, apricots, salt, pepper, and roasted eggplant. Heat through until the bell peppers are soft but still crunchy.
We highly recommend serving the curry with coconut yogurt, mint, and lemon as the flavours really help to elevate the flavours. Enjoy!
Notes
* Mature eggplants can impart a slightly bitter taste to a dish. As an optional step, once the eggplants have been scored, place them in a saltwater bath with 2 tsp of salt per litre of water. Soak for 10 - 15 minutes, then drain, rinse, and pat dry. This is not necessary if your eggplants are small or have few visible seeds.

16 oz (450 g) firm tofu, drained
3 cloves garlic, crushed
2 Tbsp (30 mL) sodium-reduced soy sauce
2 tsp (10 mL) sriracha hot sauce
2 tsp (9 g) granulated sugar
1 tsp (5 mL) sesame oil
½ lime, juiced
1 tsp (5 mL) vegetable oil
Pickled carrots
2 carrots, julienned
½ cup (120 mL) boiling water
½ cup (120 mL) white vinegar
1½ Tbsp (21 g) granulated sugar
1 tsp (6 g) salt
Assembly
2 large baguettes, toasted
2 Tbsp (30 mL) vegan mayonnaise
2 tsp (10 mL) sriracha hot sauce
1 cucumber, sliced
1 red hot chili pepper, thinly sliced (optional)
½ cup (8 g) fresh cilantro
2 Tbsp (30 mL) hoisin sauce
Directions
Gently squeeze the block of tofu to remove as much liquid as possible, then thinly cut into ¼ inch (½ cm) thick slices.
To a large shallow dish, add the garlic, soy sauce, sriracha, sugar, sesame oil, lime juice, and whisk. Then add the tofu to the marinade and gently toss to coat. Set aside.
To a mason jar, add the carrots, boiling water, vinegar, sugar, and salt. Screw on the lid and give it a gentle shake to dissolve the sugar. Let sit while preparing the rest of the recipe.
To a large pan on medium-high heat, add the oil and cook the tofu slices in a single layer for 3 - 5 minutes, or until golden. Do not disturb the tofu as they cook, as this can cause them to crumble.
Spoon the leftover marinade over the top of the tofu slices before giving it a flip to cook on the other side.
Spread some mayo and hot sauce inside each baguette. Layer on the tofu slices, pickled carrots, cucumber, chili pepper, and cilantro. Serve with hoisin on the side. Enjoy!
Storage
This sandwich is best enjoyed immediately.
The tofu can be made ahead of time and stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.
The pickled carrots can be made ahead of time and stored for up to 2 weeks.
 
Potato Hash Cakes with Baked Marinated Tempeh
Servings: 3
Ingredients
Baked tempeh
¼ cup (60 mL) sodium-reduced soy sauce
2 Tbsp (30 mL) maple syrup
1 Tbsp (15 mL) sriracha hot sauce
8.8 oz (250 g) tempeh
Potato hash cakes
2 medium potatoes
1 small onion
1 carrot
1 Tbsp (15 mL) olive oil
1 Tbsp (9 g) all-purpose flour
1 tsp (3 g) garlic powder
1 tsp (2 g) ground cumin
½ tsp salt
½ tsp ground black pepper
Vegetables
1 tsp (5 mL) vegetable oil
2 cups (298 g) cherry tomatoes
3 cloves garlic, crushed
5 cups (150 g) fresh spinach
1 avocado, sliced (optional)
Optional toppings
flaked sea salt
sriracha hot sauce
Directions
In a large, shallow dish, mix together the soy sauce, maple syrup, and sriracha.
Slice the tempeh into 2 mm thin slices. Transfer to the shallow dish and toss to coat. Let marinate for at least 20 minutes. Mix once or twice while it's marinating to re-coat.
Meanwhile, using a box grater, shred the potatoes and place them into a large bowl filled with cold water. Let soak for 5 minutes to reduce the starchiness of the potatoes.
Preheat the oven to 390°F (200°C). Grate the onion and carrot into a large bowl. Add the oil, flour, garlic powder, cumin powder, salt, and pepper.
Drain the potatoes, place them on a clean dry cloth and squeeze to get rid of excess water. Add to the large bowl and mix.
Use a ½ cup measure to scoop the potato mixture into flat, ½ cm thick cakes on a parchment-lined baking tray.
On another lined tray, arrange the tempeh in a single layer and reserve any leftover marinade.
Bake both trays in the oven, on the middle and lower racks, for 10 minutes. Then flip both the potato cakes and tempeh slices. Use any leftover marinade to drizzle on the second side of the tempeh. Rotate the position of the trays in the oven and bake for another 10 - 15 minutes, or until golden and crispy.
Meanwhile, heat a medium pan on medium-high heat with oil. Add the cherry tomatoes and cook until the skins start to pop, about 2 minutes.
Then add the crushed garlic and cook until fragrant and golden, about 3 - 4 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside.
To the now-empty pan, add the spinach. Stir often, and remove from the heat once fully wilted.
To serve, use a potato cake as the base, top with a few slices of baked tempeh, then the cooked spinach and blistered tomatoes. Top with avocado slices, and enjoy!
Storage
Best if this is enjoyed immediately.
Store each component separately in its own airtight container for up to 3 days.

Simple Oatmeal Pancakes
Servings: 2
Ingredients
Pancakes

2 Tbsp (30 mL) maple syrup
1 Tbsp (14 g) refined coconut oil, melted, plus extra for frying‡
2 tsp (5 g) ground cinnamon
1 tsp (3 g) baking powder
1 tsp (5 mL) pure vanilla extract
½ tsp salt
Toppings
½ cup (120 mL) unsweetened coconut yogurt
¼ cup (44 g) pomegranate seeds
2 Tbsp (15 g) roasted unsalted pistachios, chopped
Directions
In a food processor, blend the oatmeal into a flour. Alternatively, use store-bought oatmeal flour.
Combine all the pancake ingredients in a large bowl.
Preheat a large pan on medium-high heat with oil. When hot, spoon about ¼ cup of batter onto the pan for each pancake. Cook for about 2 minutes.
When the bottom becomes golden, flip and cook for another 2 minutes, or until lightly golden.
For a more balanced breakfast, enjoy these pancakes with some creamy nut butter drizzled overtop, fresh fruit, and creamy plant-based yogurt.
Notes
† Nutrition tip: aim to use plant-based milk that is fortified with calcium.
‡ Refined coconut oil is coconut oil that doesn't smell or taste like coconuts. If you prefer a distinct coconut taste, use unrefined coconut oil instead.
Storage
Keep in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 days.
Frozen, these can last up to two months. Freeze with pieces of parchment separating the pancakes to prevent them from sticking together.
 
Ooey-Gooey Cinnamon Buns
Servings: 12
Ingredients
Dough
1 cup (240 mL) unsweetened soy milk
1 Tbsp (12 g) active dry yeast
3 cups (414 g) all-purpose flour
¼ cup (56 g) granulated sugar
2 tsp (7 g) baking powder
1 tsp (6 g) salt
¼ cup (54 g) refined coconut oil, melted †
Filling
1 cup (220 g) brown sugar, packed
½ cup (50 g) raw pecans, finely chopped
2 tsp (5 g) ground cinnamon
¼ cup (54 g) refined coconut oil, melted
Sweetened milk
¼ cup (60 mL) unsweetened soy milk‡
1 Tbsp (15 mL) maple syrup
Icing
1 cup (134 g) powdered sugar
¼ cup (56 g) unsalted vegan butter
1 tsp (5 mL) unsweetened soy milk
1 tsp (5 mL) clear vanilla extract
Directions
Heat the milk in a saucepan until just steaming*. Do not let simmer! Remove from the heat, add the yeast, stir, and let sit for 5 minutes.
In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
When the yeast mixture is foamy, add to the flour mixture along with the melted coconut oil. Mix together.
Then use your hands and knead for 3 - 4 minutes until smooth. Add a bit more flour if needed, the dough should be slightly sticky but not stick to the bowl. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest in a warm place for 1 hour.
In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, pecans, and cinnamon. Set aside. Lightly grease a baking dish.
Transfer the dough onto a floured surface. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a ½ cm thick rectangle of 30 x 40 cm.
Spread the coconut oil across the rolled-out dough. It looks like a lot, and that's okay!
Sprinkle the brown sugar and pecan mixture evenly overtop the rolled-out dough.
With the longest edge of the rectangular dough closest to you, begin to roll the dough.
Cut the rolled dough into 12 buns, about 1½ inches (3 cm) thick each. We did this by cutting the roll in half, then in half again, and then cutting each of those quarters into thirds.
Place each bun into the baking dish, then cover it with a damp cloth and let rest in a warm place for another hour.
While the buns are resting, mix the remaining milk with the maple syrup. Set aside.
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Bake buns in the centre rack of the oven for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven to spoon the sweetened milk mixture over the buns.
Return the cinnamon buns back to the oven to bake for an additional 20 - 25 minutes, or until the tops of the buns are golden.
While the buns are baking, whisk together the icing ingredients using an electric hand mixer. Add a splash more milk if a thinner consistency is preferred.
When the buns are removed from the oven, let them cool slightly before smearing the icing overtop. Enjoy!
Notes
† Refined coconut oil is coconut oil that doesn't smell or taste like coconuts. If you prefer a distinct coconut taste, use unrefined coconut oil instead.
‡ * Try infusing the milk with cinnamon sticks, ginger, crushed cardamom pods, or chai-spiced tea bags for more festive tasting cinnamon buns.
* The aim is to achieve a “lukewarm bath” temperature. If it’s too hot, let it sit to cool slightly. Milk that's too hot may kill the yeast.
Storage
Store in an airtight container on the counter for up to 3 days.
Store the buns without the frosting in the freezer for up to 1 month, and reheat in the oven when ready to enjoy.
 
Coconut Lemon Custard Tart
Servings: 6
Ingredients
Crust
7 digestive cookies†
1 Tbsp (14 g) refined coconut oil, melted ‡
Filling
11 oz (300 g) silken tofu
1 lemon, zested, juiced
⅓ cup (80 mL) coconut cream††
2 Tbsp (28 g) granulated sugar
1 Tbsp (8 g) cornstarch
2 tsp (10 mL) pure vanilla extract
Optional toppings
fresh mixed berries
lemon slice
stewed berries
unsweetened toasted coconut flakes
Directions
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). In a small food processor, blend the cookies and coconut oil into a crumb. Alternatively, crush it all together using a fork if you don't have a food processor.
Pour the crust mixture into a 17-inch (18 cm) spring form pan. Use the flat bottom of a cup to press the crumbs into a crust*.
In a blender, combine the tofu, lemon zest and juice, coconut milk, sugar, cornstarch, and vanilla. Pour the mixture into the prepared crust.
Lightly tap the pan on a solid surface to get rid of any bubbles.
Bake in the centre rack of the oven for 25 - 30 minutes, until the edges are lightly golden and the topped is cracked**.
Let cool at room temp for 30 minutes, then transfer to the fridge for at least 3 hours to set. Best if it can be let to cool overnight, although not necessary.
Decorate with toppings just before servings. Enjoy!
Notes
† 7 cookies is approximately equal to 1 cup.
‡ Refined coconut oil is coconut oil that doesn't smell or taste like coconuts. If you prefer a distinct coconut taste, use unrefined coconut oil instead.
†† Aim to scoop the thick fatty part out from the top of a can of coconut milk. Avoid using a "light" coconut milk for this recipe.
* Tip: start from the middle and work your way to the sides.
** The middle will be quite liquidy. Not to worry, it will set in the fridge.
Storage
Keep in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.
 
Chocolate Chip Caramel Skillet Cookie
Servings: 8
Ingredients
Caramel sauce
½ cup (112 g) granulated sugar

Serves well with
vegan ice cream
Directions
To a saucepan on medium-high heat, dissolve the sugar in water and bring to a gentle boil.
Add the coconut cream. Continue to stir at a gentle boil until the mixture starts to thicken slightly, about 8 minutes. Then remove it from the heat; it will continue to thicken as it cools.
To a large bowl, add the flaxseeds and water, and mix. Let sit for 5 minutes to gel.
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). To the flaxseed mixture, add the margarine, sugars, and vanilla, and mash together using a fork.
Add in the flour, baking powder, salt, and chocolate chips, and mix until just combined. Careful not to overmix.
Spread ½ of the batter in a 10-inch (26 cm) cast iron skillet. Cover with ¼ cup caramel sauce, then dollop the remaining dough over the caramel and smooth out. Top with reserved chocolate for decoration.
Bake in the centre rack of the preheated oven for 30 - 35 minutes, or until the top is golden.
Best served warm from the oven. Top as desired. Enjoy!
Notes
† Coconut cream is the thicker part scooped out from the top of 2 - 3 cans of full-fat coconut milk (of at least 18% fat) that have been refrigerated overnight. The amount of coconut fat separation can vary vastly from brand to brand. If there isn’t much coconut fat in your can, consider trying again with a different brand.

Coconut Whip
Servings: 6
Ingredients
1⅓ cups (320 mL) coconut cream†
2 Tbsp (17 g) powdered sugar
1 tsp (5 mL) pure vanilla extract (optional)
Directions
Place the coconut milk can upside-down in the refrigerator for at least 5 hours, but best if left in the fridge overnight to allow the liquid to separate from the fat. Refrigerate a large bowl together with the whisks of your electric hand mixer for at least 10 minutes to cool.
Gently turn the can back right-side-up, and open the can. Pour out the liquid layer on the top, and save this for a future smoothie or curry. Using a spoon, scoop out the solid white coconut fat into a large bowl.
Whip the coconut cream for 3 - 4 minutes.
Then add in the icing sugar and vanilla, and whip again for an additional minute.
Use the coconut whip to top brownies, fruit crumbles, watermelon pizza, or as a topping on your favourite hot chocolate*.
Notes
† Coconut cream is the thick part from the top of a can of full-fat coconut milk (of at least 18% fat) refrigerated overnight. The amount of coconut fat separation can vary vastly from brand to brand. If there isn’t much coconut fat in your can, consider trying again with a different brand. 2 cans of milk are generally needed to yield 1 cup of cream.
* Note, when added to hot desserts or drinks, the coconut whip will quickly deflate - but the taste is still delicious!
Storage
Best if enjoyed immediately. The whip can be stored in the fridge in an airtight container or glass jar for up to 2 days.
 
Mango Ginger Sorbet
Servings: 4
Ingredients
½ cup (120 mL) water
½ cup (112 g) granulated sugar†
1½ mango, peeled, chopped
1 lime, juiced
½ tsp ground ginger (optional)‡
Optional garnish
fresh mint leaf
lime zest
pomegranate seeds
Directions
Start by making a simple syrup solution by placing the water into a saucepan on medium heat. Pour the sugar into the middle of the water and let it dissolve*. When the sugar is completely dissolved and the water is clear, remove from the heat and let sit to cool.
To a blender, add the mango, lime juice, ginger, and simple syrup. Blend on high until smooth.
Transfer to an airtight container and let freeze before enjoying.
Notes
† Freezing can dull flavours and make frozen treats brittle and icy. The sugar in the recipe helps resolve both of those issues!
‡ The ginger powder is subtle, so if you want more of a kick, add in grated fresh ginger or fresh ginger juice. If you're not a fan of ginger at all, just skip it in this recipe.
* Try to avoid mixing with a spoon, as the sugar will crystallize on the spoon and sides of the pan. To stir, swirl the pot.
Storage
Can be kept in an airtight container in the freezer for 1 - 2 months. Allow the sorbet to defrost at room temperature slightly before enjoying for a softer texture if desired.

Fresh Salad Rolls with a Creamy Peanut Hoisin Sauce
Servings: 3
Ingredients
Salad rolls
1.1 oz (30 g) dry white vermicelli noodles
½ cup (70 g) frozen shelled edamame
6 rice paper sheets
1 avocado, thinly sliced
2 red bell peppers, julienned
1 carrot, julienned
1 cup (70 g) shredded red cabbage
½ cucumber, seeds removed, thinly sliced
Peanut sauce
¼ cup (60 mL) peanut butter
¼ cup (60 mL) hoisin sauce
½ lime, juiced
Optional toppings
sweet chili sauce
toasted sesame seeds
Directions
Add the rice noodles and edamame into separate bowls. Pour plenty of boiling water over each. Set aside for 5 minutes, then drain.
Meanwhile, combine the peanut butter, hoisin sauce, and lime juice in a small bowl and whisk. Then add small splashes of water, 1 tsp (5 mL) at a time, and continue until you achieve your desired consistency.
In a large shallow dish, soak 1 sheet of rice paper in warm water* for about 5 - 7 seconds. The rice paper will continue to soften even after removed from the water. Do not over-soak, otherwise the rice paper will likely break when rolled.
Let the excess water drip off the paper, then transfer the sheet to a large plate. In a line across the centre, add some of the drained rice noodles, edamame, avocado, and veggies.
Wrap the salad roll like you would a burrito: folding in the sides, then tucking and rolling. Cut in half using a sharp knife**.
Serve the rolls with the peanut sauce or with a sweet chili sauce, and enjoy!
Notes
* It's better that the water be a bit cooler rather than too warm.
** It can help to lightly brush each side of the knife in just a little bit of oil, so that the rice paper and noodles don't stick to the knife.
Storage
Store in an airtight container lined with a damp paper towel or cloth in the fridge for up to 3 days.

Refreshing Ginger Mint Lemonade
Servings: 3
Ingredients
1 Tbsp (6 g) freshly grated ginger
20 fresh mint leaves, or more as desired
3 lemons, juiced
3 cups (720 mL) water
2 cups (222 g) ice cubes
2 Tbsp (30 mL) agave syrup, plus more to taste
Directions
Gather the grated ginger into your hands and squeeze over a pitcher to extract the juice*. Discard the pulp. For a more subtle ginger flavour, simply cut the ginger into slices and add it to the pitcher, instead of grating and squeezing.
Add the mint to the pitcher, and use a wooden spatula or wooden tamper to give the mint a mash. We want to bruise the mint leaves slightly to extract their flavours.
Then add the lemon juice, water, ice cubes, and syrup. Stir, add more syrup if the drink tastes too tart, and serve immediately. Cheers!
Notes
* Squeezing the ginger by hand can irritate your skin, especially if you have any cuts. Alternatively, you can use a nut milk bag to squeeze out the liquid or place the ginger into a juicer.
Storage
The ginger, lemon juice, and syrup concentrate can be prepared and kept in a mason jar in the fridge for up to 2 days. Simply dilute with water and ice cubes when you're ready for a refreshing drink.

Baked Fruit Crumble - Three Ways
Servings: 6
Ingredients
6 cups (900 g) frozen mixed berries
1 cup (81 g) rolled oats
2 Tbsp (30 mL) melted refined coconut oil, melted†
1 Tbsp (14 g) brown sugar
1 tsp (3 g) ground cinnamon
Optional toppings
roasted unsalted pecans
unsweetened coconut yogurt
vegan ice cream
Directions
Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F). If using larger berries, such as strawberries, first slice*. Divide the fruit into ramekins, or place it into a large baking dish.
In a bowl, combine the oats, melted coconut oil, brown sugar, and cinnamon. Mix to combine, then spoon over the fruit.
Bake on the middle rack of the oven for 10 - 15 minutes, or until the juices are bubbly, the fruit is tender, and the oatmeal is golden.
Remove from oven, let cool for a few minutes before serving. Top with plant yogurt, vegan ice cream, or coconut whip. Enjoy!
Notes
† Refined coconut oil is coconut oil that doesn't smell or taste like coconuts.
* If swapping out the berries for fruits such as apple, pear, or peach, try to cut the fruits into very small pieces. The smaller the pieces are, the faster they'll bake in the oven without the oatmeal on top burning.
Storage

Tropical Coconut Popsicles
Servings: 6
Ingredients
1⅔ cups (399 mL) canned full-fat coconut milk
½ cup (120 mL) pineapple juice
½ lime, juiced
¾ cup (112 g) frozen raspberries
Directions
To a medium bowl, add the coconut milk, pineapple juice, and lime juice and mix.

Meanwhile, heat the frozen raspberries in a small saucepan on the stove on medium-low heat for 3 - 5 minutes, or until fully thawed. Mash slightly to release some of the juices. Alternatively, the berries can also be thawed in the microwave. Set aside to let cool.
After the 1 - 2 hours is up, remove the mold from the freezer and spoon the raspberry mixture onto the popsicles.
Use a popsicle stick to gently push the raspberries into the popsicle to create a swirl pattern. Then carefully position the popsicle sticks in the center of the mold and return to the freezer*. Let the popsicles freeze completely.
When you want to remove a popsicle, run the bottom of the mold under hot water for a minute and twist each side to help release the popsicle. Enjoy!
Notes
* If you don't have a popsicle mold, use an ice cube tray to make mini popsicles.
* Tip: if the popsicle is too soft to hold the stick, return it to the freezer for 10 - 15 minutes more before trying again.
Storage
Store in the freezer for up to 1 month.
 
Ultra Fudgy Sea Salt Caramel Brownies
Servings: 12
Ingredients

2 Tbsp (27 g) refined coconut oil, melted†
½ cup (53 g) Dutch processed cocoa powder
1 Tbsp (15 mL) water
½ cup (55 g) roasted unsalted pecans
⅓ cup (50 g) chopped dairy-free dark chocolate
1 pinch flaked sea salt (optional)
Directions
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). In a food processor*, blend the dates, coconut oil, cocoa powder, and water until smooth.
Add the roasted pecans, chocolate, and a pinch of salt. Blend again, but let some chunks of pecans and chocolate remain.
Transfer the mixture into a parchment-lined 9 x 9 inch (21 x 21 cm) baking dish, and spread evenly. Bake for 10 minutes**.
When removed from the oven, top with some more crushed pecans, chopped chocolate, and a sprinkle of sea salt if desired. Gently press these in to secure them.
Let cool before cutting. These brownies are fudgiest if kept in the fridge. Enjoy!
Notes
† Refined coconut oil is coconut oil that doesn't smell or taste like coconuts. Using refined coconut oil is preferred to unrefined as the brownies retain a more neutral flavour.

Homemade Almond Butter
Servings: 25
Ingredients
3 cups (429 g) raw almonds
Directions
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Place the almonds onto a baking tray, and toast in the oven for 7 - 10 minutes, stirring occasionally until lightly golden*.
Add the toasted almonds to a high-powered food processor** (ideally 600W or higher) and blend on high for 5 - 7 minutes until creamy.
Continue to blend until smooth. Stopping too soon results in a thicker consistency. If your food processor isn't very powerful, you may need to blend it for an extra 5 minutes to achieve the desired consistency or consider adding a bit of oil to help the process along. Enjoy!
Notes
* The almonds will continue to "bake" even when removed from the oven, so be careful not to overcook.
** Use a food processor and not a blender for this. If the mixture heats up, let it rest to cool slightly so as to not damage your food processor.
Storage
Store in an airtight container or mason jar in a cool, dry, and dark place for up to 1 month.
Store in the fridge for up to 3 months.

½ cup (120 mL) barbecue sauce
2 tsp (10 mL) vegetable oil, for frying
6 slices whole wheat bread, toasted
2 Tbsp (30 mL) vegan mayonnaise (optional)
3 romaine lettuce leaves
1 roasted red bell pepper from a jar, sliced
1 medium tomato, sliced
1 avocado, sliced
Directions

2.8 oz (80 g) firm tofu, cut into 1 cm cubes
3 button mushrooms, sliced
1 stalk green onion, thinly sliced
½ cup (15 g) fresh spinach

Notes
* If you have extra time: pan fry the tofu in a tsp of coconut oil to crisp up the sides.
** Mason jars can get very hot, so be sure to handle them with care. If the glass jar is cold, add a small splash of hot water to the jar first and swirl around before adding the rest.

Rainbow Veggie Sushi Rolls
Servings: 3
Ingredients
Seasoned rice
1½ cups (300 g) uncooked Japanese short-grain rice
2 Tbsp (30 mL) rice vinegar
1 tsp (5 g) granulated sugar
½ tsp salt
Fillings
1 medium sweet potato, peeled, cut into ½ cm planks
6 nori seaweed sheets
1 avocado, sliced
1 mango, sliced
½ cucumber, seeds removed, thinly sliced
1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
Serves well with
pickled ginger
sodium-reduced soy sauce
toasted sesame seeds
Directions
Rinse the rice until it runs clear. Cook the rice according to the package instructions. When cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered with a lid for 5 minutes.
In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, sugar, and salt.
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Lay the sweet potato planks on a baking tray and roast in the oven until cooked through, about 20 minutes, flipping halfway. Remove from oven and let cool before cutting into thin strips.
Transfer the cooked rice to a large shallow bowl. Pour over the sugar-vinegar mixture and gently mix it in while the rice is still warm. Then let the rice cool to room temperature.
Spoon some cooled rice on the rough side of a nori sheet and spread it out*. You should still be able to see some of the seaweed below the rice. Leave about 1 inch (2 cm) of space at the top of your sheet uncovered.
Place some veggies and mango strips in a line, about 1 cm above the bottom of your roll. Then roll it up! Wet the seaweed at the top of the roll with some water to help it secure the roll shut.
Use a sharp knife** to cut the rolls into bite-sized pieces. Enjoy!
Notes
* Wet your fingers or spoon with some water to prevent it from sticking.
** Lightly coat your knife with water or oil to prevent it from sticking to the rice.
Storage
The prepared rolls are best enjoyed right away, but they can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a day. Leave in a complete roll and cut when ready to eat. This prevents the rolls from drying out.
If you have already cut your rolls: line an airtight container with a piece of moist paper towel, or a small, thin tea towel. Place your pieces on top, and wrap the cloth edges over the rolls. The moisture from the liner will keep your cut pieces chewy for at least a day.

Quick Homemade Tahini
Servings: 32
Ingredients
3 cups (384 g) raw sesame seeds
Directions
Toast the sesame seeds in a large pan on medium heat until lightly golden*. Stir constantly. The seeds continue to 'cook' even when taken off the heat, so be careful not to over toast them.
Transfer the cooled toasted seeds to a food processor (ideally 600W or more) and blend for 5 - 7 minutes**.
The key to smooth and runny tahini is to give it time, so keep blending. Transfer to a container and enjoy!
Notes
* Usually tahini is made from raw, hulled sesame seeds. We choose to lightly toast the sesame seeds to bring out its flavour more.
** Using a blender for this is not advised. If your food processor isn't very powerful, you may need to blend it for an extra 5 minutes or add a bit of oil to help the process along. If the mixture heats up, let it rest to cool so as to not damage your food processor.
Storage
Store in a mason jar in the fridge for up to 3 months.

1 tsp (3 g) ground cinnamon
½ tsp salt
2½ cups (202 g) rolled oats, divided
¾ cup (134 g) Medjool dates, pits removed

Directions
Add the ground flaxseeds and water to a small bowl. Mix and sit aside.
Line or lightly grease a 9 x 13 inch (18 x 27 cm) baking dish. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
To the food processor, add the hazelnuts, cinnamon, salt, and half of the oats. Blend into a flour.
Transfer to a large bowl and add the remaining oats to the bowl as well.
Returning to the empty food processor, add the dates and blend until a paste is formed.
Then add the almond butter, coconut oil, vanilla extract, and gelled flaxseeds. Blend until well combined.
Transfer the sticky mixture from the food processor into the large bowl with the dry ingredients. Add the cranberries, pumpkin seeds, pecans, and chocolate to the bowl as well. Mix well.

Notes
† Refined coconut oil is coconut oil that doesn't smell or taste like coconuts. If you prefer a distinct coconut taste, use unrefined coconut oil instead.

Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C) and line or lightly grease an 11 x 7 inch (30 x 20 cm) baking dish.
To the bowl containing the flaxseed mixture, add the cocoa powder, milk, oil, sugar, maple syrup, baking powder, vanilla, and salt. Mix well.
Then add in the flour, stirring gently until just combined. Try to not overmix.
Lastly, fold in the chocolate chunks.
Pour into the baking dish and bake on the middle rack for 15 - 17 minutes, or until the top is firm to the touch, and a toothpick inserted into the centre comes out clean.
Remove from the oven and let sit for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely*.
Top the brownies with the vegan whip cream or ice cream. Enjoy!
Notes
† Refined coconut oil is coconut oil that doesn't smell or taste like coconuts. If you prefer a distinct coconut taste, use unrefined coconut oil instead.
* In our opinion, these brownies taste even more flavourful and fudgey the next day after they've been refrigerated.

Vegan Caramel Popcorn
Servings: 4
Ingredients
Popcorn
2 tsp (9 g) refined coconut oil†
½ cup (96 g) popcorn kernels
Caramel sauce
1 Tbsp (14 g) refined coconut oil, melted
3 Tbsp (45 mL) maple syrup
2 tsp (10 mL) pure vanilla extract
¼ tsp baking soda
⅛ tsp ground cinnamon
1 pinch salt
Directions
Heat the coconut oil in a heavy-bottomed large pot on high heat. Add the popcorn kernels, stir, and cover. Shake the pan back and forth every 15 seconds to heat the kernels evenly. When you hear a pop, lower the heat to medium-high and let the popcorn kernels pop away while shaking almost continuously. When the popping slows, remove from heat and keep the lid on until the popping stops.
To make the caramel sauce, add the remaining coconut oil and maple syrup to a small pan on medium-high heat. Allow to gently simmer for 2 minutes, stirring throughout*. Then remove the pan from the heat, and stir in the vanilla, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.
Drizzle the caramel sauce over the popcorn and toss to coat. Spread out the popcorn onto parchment paper and let sit for 5 minutes to harden as it cools. Enjoy!
Notes
† Refined coconut oil is coconut oil that doesn't smell or taste like coconuts. If you prefer a strong coconut taste, use unrefined coconut oil instead. The coconut oil needs to be solid for this recipe, and not melted. If the oil is soft, place it in the fridge until hardened.
* Don't remove from the heat too soon, as the sugar and oil won’t harden and crisp when added to the popcorn, but also be careful not to over-cook as the sugar can burn.
Storage
Best if enjoyed immediately, otherwise store in an airtight container on the counter for up to 1 day.

Remove the saucepan from the heat. Stir in the vanilla, plate, add desired toppings, and enjoy!
Notes
† Nutrition tip: aim to use plant-based milk that is fortified with calcium.
* The banana will start to partially dissolve as it cooks, which naturally sweetens the oatmeal.

Then add the milk, cocoa powder, maple syrup, vanilla, baking powder, baking soda, instant coffee, and salt. Mix well. The mixture might look a bit clumpy, and that's okay*.
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Add the flour to the bowl and stir until just combined. Careful to not over-mix.
Then gently fold in the chopped chocolate.
Form little balls out of the dough and evenly distribute, about 2 inches (5 cm) apart, on a lined baking tray.

Let cool on the tray for a bit before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy!
Notes
† Refined coconut oil is coconut oil that doesn't smell or taste like coconuts. If you prefer a distinct coconut taste, use unrefined coconut oil instead. The coconut oil needs to be solid for this recipe, and not melted. If the oil is soft, place it in the fridge until hardened.
* If the temperature is warm where you are, consider chilling this mixture in the fridge for 30 minutes to firm up, otherwise, the cookies may spread too much when baking.

Optional garnishes
red hot chili pepper

Directions
Lightly boil or use a steamer basket to steam the tempeh in a large pan on the stove for 10 minutes. This is an optional step, but can remove bitterness, and helps the tempeh soak up more marinade. Then rinse and pat dry.

Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Place the marinated tempeh on a parchment-lined baking tray, and bake for 15 minutes. Then flip the pieces over and bake for another 10 minutes. Remove from oven and brush with additional BBQ sauce if desired.
Meanwhile, add all of the dressing ingredients to a bowl and whisk.
Add the soba noodles and edamame to a pot of boiling water. Return to a soft boil and cook for 5 minutes, or until the noodles are al dente*. Drain and rinse.
Heat a large pan on medium-high heat. When hot, add the oil and garlic and sauté for 2 minutes. Add the carrot and mushrooms and sauté for 5 minutes.
Then add the broccoli and cook for an additional 2 minutes. Add the drained noodles and edamame to the pan. Pour over the dressing and toss to combine. Divide into bowls, add the BBQ tempeh, garnish, and enjoy.

1 cup (150 g) frozen blueberries
2 Tbsp (21 g) whole chia seeds
1 Tbsp (15 mL) apple juice
Directions
Thaw the berries in a saucepan on medium heat*. When softened, mash with a fork or spatula allowing some chunks to remain.
Then stir in the chia seeds and juice. Remove from the heat and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes for the chia seeds to gel, stirring once halfway.
Transfer to your jar, and enjoy on toast, on oatmeal, in breakfast parfaits, and more!
Notes
† Using frozen berries are preferred to fresh because they release some juice when defrosted - this juice is then absorbed by the chia seeds to gel.
* Alternatively, place the berries in a bowl and microwave at 600W for about 3 minutes, stopping to stir every minute.
Storage
Store in an airtight container or mason jar in the fridge for up to 5 days.
 
Muhammara - Roasted Red Pepper & Walnut Spread
Servings: 6
Ingredients
2 red bell peppers, seeds removed, halved†
1 tsp (5 mL) olive oil
½ cup (50 g) raw walnuts
⅔ cup (72 g) breadcrumbs
½ lemon, juiced
1 Tbsp (15 mL) pomegranate molasses
1 Tbsp (15 mL) olive oil
1 clove garlic
2 tsp (10 mL) agave syrup
1 tsp (2 g) ground cumin
½ tsp salt
⅛ tsp cayenne pepper , or more to taste
Optional garnishes
lemon slice
pomegranate seeds
small pita bread
Directions
Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C). Toss the bell peppers and oil on a lined baking tray and roast for 20 minutes. Rotate once halfway to ensure even cooking.
Then add the raw walnuts to the baking tray and continue to roast for another 5 - 6 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool. Once cool enough to handle, pull the skin off of the bell peppers.

Best Ever Vegan Nutella
Servings: 24
Ingredients
1½ cups (202 g) raw hazelnuts
⅓ cup (80 mL) unsweetened soy milk
1 Tbsp (14 g) refined coconut oil, melted†
2 Tbsp (30 mL) maple syrup
6 Medjool dates, pits removed
⅓ cup (35 g) Dutch processed cocoa powder
1 tsp (5 mL) pure vanilla extract
¼ tsp salt
Directions
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Spread the hazelnuts onto a baking tray and bake for 10 - 12 minutes, until lightly golden, stirring once halfway*.
When cooled enough to handle, pick up the hazelnuts a handful at a time and rub firmly between the palms of your hands so the skin falls off. Alternatively, the hazelnuts can be rubbed in a clean kitchen cloth. Place the peeled hazelnuts in a high-speed food processor** (ideally 600W or higher).
Blend on high for 4 - 5 minutes, until a nut butter consistency is formed***. Add the remaining ingredients and blend again until smooth.
Taste test. If you prefer a thinner consistency, consider adding more coconut oil and a touch more maple syrup and blend again. Enjoy!
Notes
† Refined coconut oil is coconut oil that doesn't smell or taste like coconuts. If you prefer a distinct coconut taste, use unrefined coconut oil instead.
* Careful to not overcook, as the nuts continue to 'toast' when taken out of the oven.
* Using a blender for this is not advised, as there is not enough liquid.
*** If your food processor isn't very powerful, you may need to blend it for an extra 5 minutes to achieve the desired consistency or consider adding a bit of vegetable oil to help the process along. If you notice the mixture heats up too much, let it rest to cool slightly so as to not damage your food processor.
Storage
Store in a mason jar in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.

One-Bowl Oatmeal Blueberry Muffins
Servings: 12
Ingredients
Muffins
2 Tbsp (14 g) ground flaxseeds
1 cup (240 mL) unsweetened soy milk
1 tsp (5 mL) white vinegar
⅓ cup (73 g) refined coconut oil, melted†
½ cup (120 mL) unsweetened applesauce
½ cup (112 g) granulated sugar
1 tsp (5 mL) pure vanilla extract
1 tsp (3 g) baking powder
½ tsp ground cinnamon
½ tsp baking soda
¼ tsp salt
2 cups (208 g) oat flour‡
1¼ cups (188 g) fresh blueberries††
Sprinkle topping (optional)
½ Tbsp (7 g) granulated sugar
⅛ tsp ground cinnamon
Directions
In a large bowl, mix together the flaxseeds, milk, and vinegar and allow it to sit for 5 minutes to slightly thicken.
Lightly grease or line a muffin tin and preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
Returning to the bowl, add the oil, applesauce, sugar, vanilla, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt. Mix well.
Then add the oat flour and mix until combined.
Place roughly 1 Tbsp of batter into each muffin. This helps to create a 'buffer' so that the blueberries don't sink to the bottom.
To the remaining batter, add the blueberries and gently stir them through. Divide the rest of the batter evenly into the muffin wells to fill them up.
For the optional topping, mix the sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl and then sprinkle over top of the muffins.
Bake the muffins on the middle rack of the oven for about 20 minutes. Let cool in the muffin tin for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Enjoy!
Notes
† Refined coconut oil is coconut oil that doesn't smell or taste like coconuts. If you prefer a distinct coconut taste, use unrefined coconut oil instead.
‡ Make your own oat flour by blending rolled oats in a food processor until a flour consistency is reached.
†† Using frozen blueberries instead of fresh berries will create streaks in the batter resulting in more grey-coloured muffins, but the taste will still be delicious! Alternatively, you could divide the blueberry-free batter between the wells, and then gently press the frozen blueberries into the batter. This minimizes streaking.
Storage
Nothing beats a fresh blueberry muffin, but if you are storing them, keep them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 days, or in the freezer for up to 2 months.
 
Classic Creamy Steel-Cut Oatmeal
Servings: 2
Ingredients
Porridge
⅔ cup (107 g) steel cut oats, soaked overnight, rinsed, drained†
2 cups (480 mL) unsweetened soy milk‡
½ tsp ground cinnamon
⅛ tsp pumpkin spice mix (optional)
1 Tbsp (7 g) ground flaxseeds
1 banana, sliced
1 tsp (5 mL) pure vanilla extract
Toppings
1 nectarine, sliced
2 Tbsp (30 mL) almond butter
Directions
In a medium pot, add the drained oats, plant milk, cinnamon, and pumpkin pie spice. Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer. Cook for 10 - 12 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Then add the ground flaxseeds, banana, and vanilla extract. Stir and continue to cook for another 2 minutes.
When the oats are cooked through, it’s done! Add more milk if a thinner consistency is preferred, or cook for another couple of minutes to thicken.

† Soaking steel-cut oats increases nutrient absorption and helps decrease cooking time. If using unsoaked oats, double the cooking time and add about 30% more milk. Learn more about the benefits of soaking in our PUL article.
‡ Nutrition tip: aim to use plant-based milk that is fortified with calcium.
Storage
Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.
Reheat leftovers on the stove or in the microwave. If possible, add the banana fresh the next morning.

Beetroot & Red Cabbage Sauerkraut
Servings: 32
Ingredients
8 cups (560 g) shredded red cabbage
2 medium raw beets, peeled, grated
1½ Tbsp (27 g) coarse sea salt (iodine free)†
1 Tbsp (5 g) whole coriander seeds
Directions
To a large bowl, add the cabbage, beetroot, and salt.
Work the salt into the vegetables by firmly massaging with your clean hands*. Continue to massage and squeeze for 10 - 15 minutes. The cabbage will soften as you continue to massage, and liquids will naturally release to create a brine.
When finished massaging, mix in the coriander seeds. Transfer the mixture, including the brine, into a clean glass jar. Do not fill the jar beyond ¾ full as the sauerkraut needs some "breathing" room.
Firmly push down the mixture until the vegetables are fully submerged under the brine. If not fully submerged, mix ½ teaspoon of salt in 1 cup (240 mL) of water and add this to the jar.
Place a clean weight on top of the vegetables to keep them fully submerged under the brine throughout the fermentation process. For our weight, we used a small glass jar filled with rice (see photo).
Close with an air-tight lid and allow the sauerkraut to ferment for 5 - 10 days away from direct sunlight and at a moderate temperature, about 18 - 24°C (65 - 75°F).
Every day, pop open the lid of the jar to allow the gas to escape*. If needed, press down the weight on top of the sauerkraut to ensure all the veggies remain submerged.
Taste test after 4 days to determine when you’d like to stop fermentation.
Once fermented, seal the jar airtight with a lid and place it in the fridge until ready to enjoy.
Notes
† The salt must be iodine-free, otherwise the salt may inhibit the fermentation process.
* The salt may cause skin irritation if you have any minor cuts on your hands. If desired, use clean gloves.
* Bubbles will naturally form on top throughout the fermentation process, this is normal and not a cause for concern.
Storage
Store in an airtight container or mason jar, preferably with a plastic lid (rather than metal) in the fridge for up to 3 months.

Potato Crisps with Creamy Tahini Dill Dip
Servings: 4
Ingredients
The crisps
2 medium potatoes
1 Tbsp (15 mL) vegetable oil
⅛ tsp salt
The dip
¼ cup (60 mL) tahini
¼ cup (4 g) fresh dill, minced
3 Tbsp (45 mL) water
1 Tbsp (15 mL) vegan mayonnaise
1 tsp (5 mL) fresh lemon juice
½ tsp agave syrup
1 pinch salt, to taste
1 pinch ground black pepper, to taste
Directions
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking tray with parchment paper. Thinly slice the potatoes into ¼ cm thin rounds, ideally using a mandolin. Otherwise, cut using a knife and cut as uniformly as possible so that they cook evenly.
Add the sliced potatoes to a large bowl, along with the oil and salt and toss to ensure the potatoes are evenly coated.
Transfer the slices to the baking tray in a single layer. Bake on the centre rack of the oven until golden, about 16 - 20 minutes, flipping once halfway. Keep an eye on them near the end as the potato slices are thin and can burn easily. If you are using multiple trays, either bake them 1 tray at a time or rotate the pans for even cooking.
When golden, remove from the oven and transfer to a rack to cool for maximum crispness.
While the potatoes are in the oven, add all the dip ingredients to a bowl and whisk together. Add a touch more water if you prefer a thinner consistency.
Serve the crispy potatoes with the dip, and enjoy!

Homemade Kombucha: Continuous Brew
Servings: 14
Ingredients
8 bags organic, unflavoured green tea, black tea, or mix†
1 cup (200 g) organic cane sugar
2 cups (480 mL) starter tea, from previous batch of kombucha, or from unpasteurized, neutral-flavored, store-bought kombucha
14 cups (3360 mL) boiling water
1 SCOBY, homemade from previous batch, given by friend, or purchased online‡
Directions
Place a large glass container in a dark, undisturbed location at room temperature. If you use a container with a spigot (which makes bottling a lot easier), choose a container with either a plastic spigot or a high-quality stainless steel spigot (304 grade or higher)*. Ideally, place the container about 10 inches (25 cm) off the floor to allow for ease of bottling. It will be hard to move the vessel when the tea has been added, so start with this step first.
Make the sweetened tea by combining the boiled water, sugar, and tea in a clean glass container or pot. Stir to dissolve the sugar and allow it to steep until the tea has cooled to room temperature**.
When cooled, remove the tea bags (or strain out the loose leaf tea) and add the sweetened tea to the large glass container.
Add the starter tea to the large glass container as well. The starter tea serves to acidify the sweetened tea to a point where bad bacteria cannot take over.
Then gently place the SCOBY on top of the liquid with clean hands.
Cover the container with a clean cloth, paper towel, or coffee filter and secure it with a rubber band. Avoid using cheesecloth, as the small openings are large enough for fruit flies to enter.
Ferment for 6 to 10 days. Check on the kombucha periodically to ensure the SCOBY is thickening and that it looks healthy (no black spots or signs of fruit fly larvae). The SCOBY may not always float at the top, and that's okay. A new cream-coloured "baby" layer of SCOBY should start forming on the surface of the kombucha within a few days.
After 6 days, give the brew a taste test. If the taste is to your liking (some like it sweeter, others like it tarter) then the kombucha is ready to bottle! Keep in mind that in warmer climates, the kombucha will ferment faster than in cooler climates. Also, the longer the tea is left to ferment, the less sweet and more acidic it becomes, as the SCOBY continues to eat up all the sugar.
Using clean glass bottles with plastic lids, gently open the spigot of the large container housing the brew and fill your bottles about ¾ full. Leave at least 2 cups (480 mL) worth of brew in the large container to serve as the "starter tea" for the next batch.
If you'd like to flavour your kombucha, add a juice of your choice to the bottle, leaving about 1 inch (2 cm) of air at the top of the bottle for carbonation. For the recipe pictured, I juiced fresh ginger and apples to add to my brew. Secure the lid and store the bottled kombucha at room temperature and out of direct sunlight for 24 - 48 hours, which will allow for carbonation. After this period, refrigerate to stop fermentation and carbonation.
To make a new batch of kombucha, make the sweetened tea as outlined above and when cooled, add this to the large vessel already containing the SCOBY and starter tea. Cover the container with a new clean cloth, paper towel, or coffee filter and secure with a rubber band. Allow the mixture to ferment for an additional 6 to 10 days.
Notes
† Substitute every 4 bags of tea for 1 Tbsp of an organic, unflavored loose leaf black or green tea.
‡ A culture of bacteria and yeast.
* This is so that the acidity of the kombucha does not degrade the metal, which could then leach into your beverage.
Read our Kombucha Tips & Troubleshooting Guide for more insights, tips, and answers to common questions.
Avoid using metal throughout the brewing process, but especially when the SCOBY has been introduced to the tea. Metal can leak into the brew and affect the taste and damage the SCOBY's growth.
It's common that for every new batch of kombucha made, a new "baby" is created that grows on top of the "mother" SCOBY. Essentially, the SCOBY replicates itself with each new batch. The more SCOBY layers that form over time, the shorter the fermentation time, as there are more bacteria and yeast to eat up the sugar. If you'd like to slow the fermentation, you can simply remove some of the older layers of SCOBY and create a "SCOBY hotel". This is essentially where you place backup SCOBYs in a clean glass jar, ensure they are fully covered with starter tea, seal with a plastic lid, and place in the fridge. It always helps to have a backup of SCOBYs in case something goes wrong. Some sources say to not refrigerate, as this can cause the SCOBY to go dormant. I've personally never had issues with this, but if you're concerned, you can store it at room temperature.
Storage
Store the bottled kombucha in the fridge for up to 1 month.
